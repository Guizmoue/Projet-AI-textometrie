   and organisations on the best practices for incorporating cyber
   security at every stage of the development process of AI algorithms.
   They focus on four key areas: secure design, secure development, secure

   When it comes to secure development, the plan advises that developers
   ensure the protection of the infrastructure used to support an AI
   system, including access controls for APIs, models and data. Moreover,

   However, the guidelines do not address other concerns regarding the use
   of AI-generated content or the data chosen for its training.

   US secretary of homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas said: “We are at
   an inflection point in the development of AI, which may well be the
   most consequential technology of our time. Cyber security is key to
   building AI systems that are safe, secure, and trustworthy.

   developing, deploying and operating AI with cyber security at its
   core.”

   ensure the ethical development of AI technologies. It follows US
   President Joe Biden’s signing of an executive order that would require
   AI developers to share the results of safety tests with the US
   government before they are released to the public. The order also
