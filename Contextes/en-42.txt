How AI could power the climate breakthrough the world needs

--
   On the other side of the world, Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi is
   developing an artificial intelligence platform to evaluate how
   vulnerable crops are to warming temperatures over the next two decades.

   “The way we think about AI is it’s a time and effectiveness multiplier
   to the solutions for climate change,” Gupta told CNN.

   Better assessing future risks for farming is just one of the ways
   artificial intelligence technologies are being used to address the
   climate crisis.

   AI first crashed into the public consciousness this year thanks to
   popular, consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, and experts say the
   technology is set to revolutionize countless industries. But climate
   researchers have for years been thinking about how AI — computer
   programs that can rapidly analyze enormous amounts of data and complete

   Everything you need to know about AI but were too afraid to ask

   Now, experts say AI is poised to accelerate everything from reducing
   pollution to improving weather models.

   “Efficiencies is one thing that AI is very good at, optimizing
   decisions, optimizing resources,” said Fengqi You, chair professor at

   AI probably won’t replace the need for humans in the climate change
   fight. But it could make their work faster and more effective.

   replanting efforts, said Dan Keeler, chief communication officer at

AI ‘doing the dirty work’ in climate research

   With the help of AI, Anna Liljedahl, a scientist at the Woodwell
   Climate Research Center, can make permafrost forecasts on a seasonal

   “AI is doing the dirty work,” Liljedahl told CNN. “But AI is not
   perfect, so we see it as a first tool, and then the human will come in
   after and really check and make sure that things make sense and explore
   the things that AI suggested.”

   The technology can also be used for solutions. A 2019 Google DeepMind
   project trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind
   turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to
   increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. AI
   can also help predict when and where energy demand is going to be

   a tremendous waste,” said Keeler.

   For now, the amount of energy used to power AI is relatively small
   compared to what’s consumed by transportation or buildings. “But this

   An October study from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the
   “worst-case scenario” suggests Google’s AI systems could eventually
   consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year,
   assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and
   software. Developers should be advised “not only to focus on optimizing
   AI, but also to critically consider the necessity of using AI in the
   first place, as it is unlikely that all applications will benefit from
   AI or that the benefits will always outweigh the costs,” the study
   concludes.
   Data center operators like Google are already thinking about how to
   reduce the resources needed to power the computing behind their AI
   models.
