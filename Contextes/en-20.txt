XTX Markets launching $10 million 'Artificial Intelligence Mathematical
Olympiad Prize'
--
   LONDON, Nov. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- XTX Markets is launching the
   Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad Prize ('AI-MO Prize'), a
   new $10mn challenge fund designed to spur the creation of a
   publicly-shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the
   International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

   A grand prize of $5mn will be awarded to the first publicly-shared AI
   model to enter an AI-MO approved competition and perform at a standard
   equivalent to a gold medal in the IMO.
--
   There will also be a series of progress prizes, totalling up to $5mn,
   for publicly-shared AI models that achieve key milestones towards the
   grand prize.
--

   Building on these traditions, the AI-MO Prize will accelerate progress
   beyond large language models like ChatGPT and develop new AI models
   that can reason mathematically. As such, the AI-MO Prize could
   represent a new Turing Test.
--

   "Using hard mathematical problems as a benchmark to determine if AI can
   match the highest cognitive functions of human beings is a wonderful
--

   I am sure that many people will be following the AI-MO Prize with great
   excitement, to see when, in the future, AI will match the world's
   brightest young minds."
--

   "Despite recent advances, using AI to solve, or at least assist with
   solving, advanced mathematical problems remains an incredibly
--

   The AI-MO Prize promises to provide at least one such set of benchmarks
   which will help compare different AI problem solving strategies at a
   technical level, in a manner that will be accessible and appealing to
--

   The prizes will be designed by an AI-MO Advisory Committee (to be
   appointed), including mathematicians, AI and machine learning experts,
   and experienced Olympiad problem-setters.

   The first AI-MO approved competitions will open to participants in
   early 2024. There will be a presentation of progress at the 65th IMO

   Geoff Smith, Former President, International Mathematical Olympiad and
   AI-MO Prize Advisory Committee Member, commented:

   "The ability of modern AI systems to create a facsimile of a human when
   engaging in a written exchange is remarkable. However, this works best
--
   delighted to be involved in supporting this competition, as we seek to
   measure AI systems against the best young mathematical minds."

--

   "XTX Markets is excited to be launching the AI-MO Prize to spur the
   development of AI models capable of mathematical reasoning. We look
   forward to working with mathematicians, scientists and technologists to
   develop the prizes, and to seeing how AI models compare against
   exceptional high-school mathematicians."
