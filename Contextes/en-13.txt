Language Is The Next Great Frontier In AI

   Building machines that can understand language has thus been a central
   goal of the field of artificial intelligence dating back to its
   earliest days.
--

   This is because mastering language is what is known as an “AI-complete”
   problem: that is, an AI that can truly understand language the way a
   human can would by implication be capable of any other human-level
   intellectual activity. Put simply, to solve language is to solve AI.

   This profound and subtle insight is at the heart of the “Turing test,”
   introduced by AI pioneer Alan Turing in a groundbreaking 1950 paper.
   Though often critiqued or misunderstood, the Turing test captures a

   passed the Turing test.) But over the past few years researchers have
   achieved startling, game-changing breakthroughs in language AI, also
   called natural language processing (NLP).
--
   The most powerful way to illustrate the capabilities of today’s
   cutting-edge language AI is to start with a few concrete examples.

   Today’s AI can correctly answer complex medical queries—and explain the
   underlying biological mechanisms at play. It can craft nuanced memos

   What is behind these astonishing new AI abilities, which just five
   years ago would have been inconceivable?
--
   In short: the invention of the transformer, a new neural network
   architecture that has unleashed vast new possibilities in AI.

   analyzed at the same time rather than in sequence. In order to support
   this parallelization, transformers rely on an AI mechanism known as
   attention. Attention enables a model to consider the relationships

   A flurry of innovation followed in the wake of the original transformer
   paper as the world’s leading AI researchers built upon this
   foundational breakthrough.

   sheer size. OpenAI has been intentional and transparent about its
   strategy to pursue more advanced language AI capabilities through raw
   scale above all else: more compute, larger training data corpora,

   unlabeled data. This is a crucial difference between today’s
   cutting-edge language AI models and the previous generation of NLP
   models, which had to be trained with labeled data. Today’s

   problematic biases of a few foundation models.”

   The source of social bias in AI models is straightforward to summarize
   but insidiously difficult to root out. Because large language models

   foundation models become increasingly influential in society. Some
   observers believe that AI bias will eventually become as prominent of
   an issue for consumers, companies and governments as digital threats

   There is no silver-bullet solution to the challenge of AI bias and
   toxicity. But as the problem becomes more widely recognized, a number

   Historically, Alphabet’s DeepMind has been an outlier among the world’s
   most advanced AI research organizations for not making language AI a
   major focus area. This changed at the end of 2021, with DeepMind

   Of the three NLP papers that DeepMind published, one is devoted
   entirely to the ethical and social risks of language AI. The paper
   proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of 6 thematic areas and 21 specific

   central focus of its NLP research going forward to help ensure that it
   is pursuing innovation in language AI responsibly.

   The fact that this dimension of language AI research—until recently,
   treated as an afterthought or ignored altogether by most of the world’s
   NLP researchers—featured so centrally in DeepMind’s recent foray into
   language AI may be a signal of the field’s shifting priorities moving
   forward.

   Increased regulatory focus on the harms of bias and toxicity in AI
   models will only accelerate this shift. And make no mistake: regulatory

   involve natural language at all. In particular, today’s cutting-edge
   language AI technology is powering remarkable breakthroughs in two
   other domains: coding and biology.
--
   It therefore makes sense that the same powerful new technologies that
   have given AI incredible fluency in natural language can likewise be
   applied to programming languages, with similar results.
--

   Then, just two weeks ago, DeepMind further advanced the frontiers of AI
   coding with its publication of AlphaCode.

   AlphaCode is an AI system that can compete at a human level in
   programming competitions. In these competitions, which attract hundreds

   with up to hundreds of lines of code. AlphaCode almost seems to display
   that ever-elusive attribute in AI, high-level reasoning.

   thinking informed by experience. For artificial intelligence to help
   humanity, our systems need to be able to develop problem-solving

   Another subfield of biology that represents fertile ground for language
   AI is the study of proteins. Proteins are strings of building blocks
   known as amino acids, linked together in a particular order. There are

   As one example, an AI research team from Salesforce recently built an
   NLP model that “learns the language of proteins” and can generate

   These efforts are just the beginning. In the months and years ahead,
   language AI will make profound contributions to our understanding of
   how life itself works.

   Language is at the heart of human intelligence. It therefore is and
   must be at the heart of our efforts to build artificial intelligence.
   No sophisticated AI can exist without mastery of language.

   Today, the field of language AI is at an exhilarating inflection point,
   on the cusp of transforming industries and spawning new
