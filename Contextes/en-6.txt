Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence
   involves a program doing something that we would normally think would
   rely on the intelligence of a human.

Artificial intelligence
   can revolutionize any professional sector. Let's see some of them

   The phrase "human error" was born because humans make mistakes from
   time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they
Artificial intelligence
   are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain
   set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching
   accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.

   of human error.

   2) Takes risks instead of Humans:

   defuse a bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and

   Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant

   can help us to minimize the effect of radiation by controlling the fire

   don't even get bored, unlike humans.

   Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many

   4) Helping in Repetitive Jobs:
--
   In our day-to-day work, we will be performing many repetitive works
   like sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors
artificial intelligence
   automate these mundane tasks and can even remove "boring" tasks for
   humans and free them up to be increasingly creative.

   Example: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents to get

   Example: We all know that organizations have a customer support team

   the organizations can set up a Voice bot or Chatbot which can help
   customers with all their queries. We can see many organizations already

   6) Faster Decisions:

   decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While
   taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and
AI
   delivers the results in a faster way.

   Example: We all have played Chess games in Windows. It is nearly

   game. It will take the best possible step in a very short time
   according to the algorithms used behind it.

   8) New Inventions:

   humans solve the majority of complex problems.

   cause a problem to future generations.

   3) Unemployment:

AI
   with robots,human interference is becoming less which will cause a
   major problem in the employment standards. Every organization is

   SUMMARY:

Artificial Intelligence
   Every new invention or breakthrough will have both, but we as humans
   need to take care of that and use the positive sides of the invention

   advantages. The key for humans will ensure the "rise of the robots"
   doesn't get out of hand. Some people also say that Artificial
