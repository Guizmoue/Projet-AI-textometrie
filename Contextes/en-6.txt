Advantages and Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence

--

   Artificial Intelligence is one of the emerging technologies which tries
   to simulate human reasoning in AI systems. John McCarthy invented the
   term Artificial Intelligence in the year 1950.

   Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer program to learn
   and think. Everything can be considered Artificial intelligence if it
   involves a program doing something that we would normally think would
--

   The advantages of Artificial intelligence applications are enormous and
   can revolutionize any professional sector. Let’s see some of them

   time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they
   are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions
   are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain
--

   Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority
   of human error.

   This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial intelligence. We
   can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot
   which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars,
--
   Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
   explosion in Ukraine? At that time there were no AI-powered robots that
   can help us to minimize the effect of radiation by controlling the fire

   AI Robots can be used in such situations where intervention can be
   hazardous.

   weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life. But
   using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they
   don’t even get bored, unlike humans.
--
   Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many
   queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.

--
   like sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors
   and many more things. Using artificial intelligence we can productively
   automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for
--
   Example: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents to get
   a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the bank. Using AI
   Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the process of verifying
--
   Example: We all know that organizations have a customer support team
   that needs to clarify the doubts and queries of the customers. Using AI
   the organizations can set up a Voice bot or Chatbot which can help
--

   Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take
   decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While
   taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and
   practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and
   delivers the results in a faster way.
--
   Example: We all have played Chess games in Windows. It is nearly
   impossible to beat CPU in the hard mode because of the AI behind that
   game. It will take the best possible step in a very short time
--

   AI is powering many inventions in almost every domain which will help
   humans solve the majority of complex problems.
--
   Example: Recently doctors can predict breast cancer in the woman at
   earlier stages using advanced AI-based technologies.

--

   As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get
   updated with time to meet the latest requirements. Machines need
--

   AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority
   of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can
--

   As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works
   with robots,human interference is becoming less which will cause a
   major problem in the employment standards. Every organization is
   looking to replace the minimum qualified individuals with AI robots
   which can do similar work with more efficiency.
--

   These are some advantages and disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence.
   Every new invention or breakthrough will have both, but we as humans
   need to take care of that and use the positive sides of the invention
   to create a better world. Artificial intelligence has massive potential
   advantages. The key for humans will ensure the “rise of the robots”
--
   intelligence can destroy human civilization if it goes into the wrong
   hands. But still, none of the AI applications made at that scale that
   can destroy or enslave humanity.
