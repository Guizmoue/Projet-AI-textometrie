As Artificial Intelligence plays an important role in our everyday lives,
implementing social awareness is the next step toward the future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), according to researchers.

   independently prioritise the appointments. A team of researchers has
   argued that the future of AI calls for the implementation of social
   intelligence to ensure that the growth of the technology is not stunted
--
   The work, ‘Artificial Social Intelligence: A Comparative and Holistic
   View,’ is published in CAAI Artificial Intelligence Research.

Artificial Social Intelligence is the future of AI

   “Artificial Intelligence has changed our society and our daily life,”
   said first author Lifeng Fan, National Key Laboratory of General
   Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Institute for General Artificial
   Intelligence (BIGAI). “What is the next important challenge for AI in
   the future? We argue that Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI) is the
   future of AI.”

--
   is important to use cognitive science and computational modelling to
   identify the gap between AI systems and human social intelligence, as
   well as current issues and future problems, for future advancements in
   AI.

AI models should incorporate social cues

--
   Fan argues that ASI requires a comprehensive approach, as unlike
   contemporary AI systems, improving specific components of an ASI system
   may not always result in improved performance. Instead, the future of
   AI needs technology that has the ability to interpret social cues, such
   as eye-rolling or yawning, to understand the mental state of other
--
   as well as consideration for how to introduce better human-like biases
   into ASI models to accelerate the future of AI.

--
   set up new evaluation protocols, and build new computational models.
   The ultimate goal is to equip AI with high-level ASI and lift human
   well-being with the help of Artificial Social Intelligence.”
