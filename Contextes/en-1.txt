   BERLIN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - France, Germany and Italy have reached an
   agreement on how artificial intelligence should be regulated, according
   to a joint paper seen by Reuters, which is expected to accelerate
--
   The three governments support "mandatory self-regulation through codes
   of conduct" for so-called foundation models of AI, which are designed
   to produce a broad range of outputs. But they oppose "un-tested norms."

   "Together we underline that the AI Act regulates the application of AI
   and not the technology as such," the joint paper said. "The inherent
   risks lie in the application of AI systems rather than in the
   technology itself."

   "An AI governance body could help to develop guidelines and could check
   the application of model cards," the joint paper said.
--
   with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, said laws and state control
   should not regulate AI itself, but rather its application.

--
   pleased an agreement had been reached with France and Germany to limit
   only the use of AI.

   "We need to regulate the applications and not the technology if we want
   to play in the top AI league worldwide," Wissing said.

--
   As governments around the world seek to capture the economic benefits
   of AI, Britain in November hosted its first AI safety summit.

--

   Issues surrounding AI will also be on the agenda when the German and
   Italian governments hold talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
