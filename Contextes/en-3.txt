Art direction vs artificial intelligence: A helpful tool or an added hassle?

   AI-powered text-to-image tools are presenting a moral quandary in terms
   of creative ethics. But is there a way to use such tools while

   In this third article of Shades of Intelligence, a new series
   investigating artificial intelligence and the creative industry, we
   look at how machine learning might reshape the research stage of a

   know. This article investigates the visual research stage of a project,
   from moodboarding to art direction. For further investigations into AI
   and the creative process, head here.

   As things stand presently with artificial intelligence, it’s fair to
   say that most creatives have taken a few cautious initial steps into
   using machine learning. As our survey results suggest, 83% of creatives
   have already used AI tools, but wariness increases when the possibility
   of using these tools to actually create imagery comes to the fore.

   the alias Infinite Vibes. Originally a sound designer, the artist was
   initially attracted to AI as it offered a playground “ripe for
   experimentation,” as he describes it. A little over two years ago, a
   friend recommended a very early iteration of a Google Colab AI notebook
   – where users can write code in a browser format – and Dom, being “a
   bit obsessive by nature,” was hooked. Since that fateful day in June
   2021, he can count on one hand the days he hasn’t opened an AI tool or
   programme. He’s also busier than ever. “I’ve been freelance for almost
--
   of colourists and cinematographers. Given his deep understanding of
   AI’s capabilities, he can also create work fully on his own, and in a
   style he has taken the time to develop – an approach that is mindful in
   respect to other artists when it comes to moodboarding, but remains
   open-minded to AI-generated possibilities. “Art has been my life, for
   my entire life. I have a lot of sympathy and compassion for traditional
--
   modern artists. I am very careful about that and put a lot into work
   that’s not AI.” In short, the work of Infinite Vibes is, he says,
   “augmented by AI, rather than being dreamt up by it.”

   A recent example is Infinite Vibes’ music video for Jessy Lanza, I Hate
   Myself, created entirely by Dom and 15 separate AI tools. A dreamscape
   of images of Jessy presented as a variety of artworks, I Hate Myself

   The initial visualisation of these ideas will be created by Dom,
   usually in Blender, but then fed into AI tools for expansion. In this
   case, that first step began with the idea of a model of Jessy. To make

   extend these to the 16:9 ratio needed for a music video, using
   Photoshop’s Generative Fill tool. To give the AI Jessy Lanza the
   ability to sing, Jessy sent Dom an acapella version of the song to be
   used in another AI tool called SadTalker, which Dom used to make
   Jessy’s mouth and face move in sync with the song.

   Warp Fusion, which specialises in taking in video files so Dom can
   augment his animations with AI generation. Stable Diffusion can also be
   run locally on your own computer and, as it’s open source, “there’s a

   “optical flow” to keep the finished product coherent. “The issue with
   AI animation is if you’re feeding frames through, it will see every
   frame as a new image, applying a new diffusion over the top. You then

   and references still lead the work. As you can see in his lengthy
   process, AI doesn’tautomate his creativity, a process which still needs
   clarification from those who commission him: “Clients still don’t know

   like I’m filling in the blocks a computer came up with,” he says,

   peers. Respondents from the field of illustration were the least likely
   to have used AI in their practice, and were also the discipline most
   worried about AI’s impact on employment: 71% of illustrators stated
   they were concerned about how AI will affect their jobs, in comparison
   to 37% of all other respondents. Such concern is of course justified,

   honesty and transparency should be a given in our industry (whether
   you’re using an AI tool or not). However, until potential regulations
   are in place, one way to gain a better grasp on AI’s impact on
   illustration is to experiment, as Seba has.

   additional options from the AI.” Then, he’ll take matters back into his
   own hands, opening Illustrator and vectorising the result and editing

   image,” the illustrator explains. “The AI takes that information and
   returns a set of four images based on it, which sometimes align with my

   intelligence”, when it comes to artists’ work being used in wider data
   sets. Interestingly, Seba’s AI experiments are also continuously well
   received amongst his community online. Much of this respect seems to be
   the result of Seba outwardly demonstrating his process, posting the
   original, the failures and the final AI-collaborated piece together. “I
   believe that showing the visual progression of a work from conception
   to completion can inspire curiosity and value,” he says. “In addition,
   my approach to AI focuses on free exploration… This constant search for
   innovation and authenticity is what can help create a connection with

   much of his work will be in tandem with an art director’s brief, the
   illustrator states how integrating AI into this back and forth could be
   viewed “as a positive thing,” he says. “I think it opens a door to a
   closer collaboration between [illustrators and art directors].” For
   example, Seba recently collaborated with fellow AI-inquisitive artists
   to generate prompts separately “and, once we had the images we liked,

   approach could be applied with an art director who set out to work with
   AI. We could each bring our perspective to the table and, from there,
   we would begin to generate images that would gradually approach a final

   and commissioned artist, there are of course agencies developing

   Wagner’s Ring, Base pitched the idea of leaving artwork generation in
   the hands of AI – a concept loved by the designers creating the work,
   and the opera house itself.

   Not only offering a conceptual nod to La Monnaie’s programming, using
   AI in such a large campaign seemingly offered Base the opportunity to
   create a boundary-pushing, experiential identity system. Not to mention

   team member recalls a distinctive level of excitement towards the use
   of AI, sentimentally likening it to the same feeling they had as
   students. “It was so fun,” says design director Aurore plainly. “We

   into still images” through animation, also working with Tokkin Heads,
   “an AI that generates characters and the facial features to apply a
   templated animation, or just record with your webcam to create an

   framing interpolation, which generates in-between frames for a
   type-to-image transition. The final AI tool the team employed was
   Upscayl, used to upscale every image generated to principal resolution.

   Although these steps appear simple when noted down, the actual process
   of working with AI in a design context wasn’t without its challenges.
   Firstly, the imagery generated by Dall-E tested the creative limits of
--
   culture of content. We understood that we were still needed, which is
   the whole question around AI.”

   Like Seba’s communication approach, since completing the La Monnaie
   project Base has been extremely open, and proud, of this use case of AI
   as art direction and design. As pointed out by Manon: “It’s our duty to

   Arguably this is due to the fact that AI was only implemented due to
   its relevance for the overall theme of the opera season at hand, rather
   than “an excuse not to work, or have AI as a buzzword,” says Bruce. “On
   this project I received a lot of questions about whether AI is going to
   replace our jobs. In our personal experience, I think in many ways it
   can. But that’s more of a choice than an actual fate you have to
   accept. There are a few agencies working towards owning AI as their
   unique selling point, but I’m not sure whether that’s the strongest way
--
   will take our jobs.” Interestingly, since completing the project Base
   hasn’t used AI tools to this extent again, because, with this
   experience in mind, the concept hasn’t called for it.

   Within the context of using AI tools creatively, the moodboarding,
   commissioning and art direction steps discussed here are arguably the
