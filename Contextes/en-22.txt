   Sports Illustrated deleted web articles after a report claimed they
   were generated by artificial intelligence and published under fake
   author names.
--
   Tech publisher Futurism reported the issue after finding author
   headshots on an AI-generated image website.

--
   the articles in question were written and edited by humans" and that
   the e-commerce firm regularly uses "counter-plagiarism and counter-AI
   software".
--
   pseudonyms "in certain articles" to protect their privacy, however.
   That was why the AI-generated pictures were used and the author names
   cannot be found elsewhere on the internet.
--
   This incident at Sports Illustrated comes as concern grows in the media
   world that generative artificial intelligence could cheaply replace
   journalists and potentially spread misinformation. Various newsrooms
   have experimented with AI or released guidelines for employees and
   audiences to explain their approach towards it.

   Some newsrooms have made headlines, however, after publishing AI
   articles that included errors or falsehoods. Others gained attention
   for not marking stories as AI generated.
