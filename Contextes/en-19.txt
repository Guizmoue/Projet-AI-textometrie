   Gutenberg University Mainz, and Mainz University of Applied Sciences
   has unveiled an AI system capable of deciphering ancient cuneiform
   texts. This novel technology, leveraging 3D models, represents a

   The team turned to AI for help.

   Using a novel AI process to decode ancient cuneiform tablets, they
   leveraged a sophisticated AI model based on the Region-based
   Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) architecture, a specialized system

   The AI’s methodology entailed a two-part pipeline: initially, a sign
   detector, built on a RepPoints model with a ResNet18 backbone,

   classified and predicted the wedges’ positions, which forms the basis
   of the cuneiform script’s fundamental elements, allowing the AI, in
   effect, to ‘read.’

   the stylus into the clay or the distance between the symbols and
   wedges. This nuanced approach enabled the AI to overcome the challenges
   posed by traditional 2D photographs, such as inconsistent lighting and

   To address this, the research team put their AI system through an
   extensive training regimen, utilizing three-dimensional scans and

   a significant project focused on creating 3D models of these ancient
   clay tablets. This enabled the AI to achieve remarkable success in
   accurately identifying the symbols inscribed on the tablets.
