   The AI revolution is here and it’s changing the world faster than
   anybody could have predicted.
--
   Whether that’s for better or worse depends on whom you ask. What’s
   undeniable is this — the only limitation on how AI will transform the
   world is us.

   Geoffrey Hinton, the so-called grandfather of AI, issued warnings this
   year, sounding the alarm about the existential threat of AI.

   York Times, announcing he had quit his job at Google to speak freely
   about the harm he believes AI will cause humanity.

--
   If Hinton is having a come-to-Jesus moment, he might be too late. Over
   100 Million people use ChatGPT, a form of AI using technology he
   invented. That’s on top of the way AI is already interwoven into
   practically everything we do online.
--
   And while Toronto-based Hinton is one of the Canadian minds leading
   this industry — one which is growing exponentially — the circle of AI
   innovators remains small.

   cameras to dictate movement.

   Choudhry was in the store testing the glasses out for himself, curious
   to see if AI could be as big a disruptor in the world of glasses as he
   intends to make it in the world of prosthetics.

   smartARM is just one of many examples of how AI is on the brink of
   revolutionizing virtually every facet of human existence. Canada is on
   the leading edge, utilizing what AI can do from healthcare and
   education to airlines and entertainment.

   There are inherent risks with AI and a lack of regulation and oversight
   in Canada, but overall, AI is improving our daily lives in ways that
   may often remain undetectable.

   Canada’s AI pioneering dates back to the 1970s, when researchers formed
   the world’s first national AI association.

   The Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association (CAIAC) formerly known
   as the Canadian Society for the Computational Studies of Intelligence,

   leadership in research, development and education in Canada’s
   artificial intelligence community by facilitating the exchange of
   knowledge through various media and venues.”

   It held its first annual conference in 1976, three years before the
   American Association for Artificial Intelligence was founded.

--
   phone calls were expensive. When you look at the earlier proceedings,
   you will see a pool of talent that was leading the world in AI,” said
   Denilson Barbosa, current CAIAC president.
--

   Its archive is a treasure trove of AI history. Its magazine debut in
   1984 talks about the potential and the influence of AI: “It is
   predictable that, awakening to their new place in the sun, AIers be
   distracted by sycophants, charlatans, and barmecides. Does the AIer
   grow frustrated with misconceptions about AI? You bet we do.”

   while Canada is slow to fully integrate AI, conservative in investing
   and implementing new technologies, he’s looking forward to the
   possibilities of AI in learning in school or for personal growth,
   including AI in classrooms.

   When most people think of AI, robots from movies — who can think for
   themselves — come to mind. That’s known as deep learning AI, found in
   the software of autonomous cars, facial recognition, mass surveillance
   and yes, some robots. It’s the AI that has the potential to think for
   itself and that scares a lot of people.

   Then there’s the field where Canada is considered a leader: the broader
   technology of machine learning AI, which most people don’t realize we
   already use every day. It curates social media feeds, translates

   Under the umbrella of machine learning, is Generative AI. It generates
   new content that mimics the data it was trained on.

   “Generative AI allows you to tune the information in a way where now
   you can actually consume the information the way you want to based on

   Most Canadians can’t tell what’s human or AI. A study released in
   October by the Canadian Journalism Foundation found that half of us are
   not confident in distinguishing the difference between social media
   content generated by AI compared with content created by humans.

   This unknown is leading to a lot of fear and misinformation about what
   AI is and isn’t doing. But whether we’re ready, it’s poised to change
   nearly everything we do and Canada is already playing a leading role.

   In 2017, the federal government put $125 million of funding into AI,
   the first country to have a national AI strategy. The funding helped to

   “For me, the biggest risk is not adopting AI and realizing its maximum

   You don’t have to look far from the Vector Institute to see AI’s
   evolution.

   Jas Jaaj, a managing partner at Deloitte in Toronto who focuses on AI
   and data, believes AI will be to the 21st century what the steam engine
   was to the 18th century, what electricity was to the 19th century, and

   Professional services firms like Deloitte help companies find the next
   big thing. And these days, it doesn’t get bigger than AI.

   Each AI nurse is unique to the patient. It has the information it
   requires to converse with a patient about their care and its skin tone,

   During the demo for Global News, the AI nurse asked: “Regarding your
   post-discharge medications, Tenzin and Lasix, do you have any questions
--

   Most importantly, the AI nurse is smart enough to flag problems for a
   human nurse or doctor to intercede.

   The goal of the AI nurse isn’t to replace human nurses, it’s to take
   tasks off their already full plates and allow them to perform
   higher-value work with more time. It can also lower readmission rates.
   Jaaj predicts 100 per cent of Canadian hospitals will begin to use AI
   in some way within the next few years.

   Regardless of the goal, it doesn’t stop one of the biggest concerns
   about progress in integrating AI into the Canadian workforce: job
   losses.

   While progress will have its casualties, Canada is very much in a
   position of relying on human input to use AI. AI can take on
   time-consuming tasks, freeing us up to solve more complicated problems.

   Pedersen has been studying wearable technology for over 20 years. Even
   she is amazed at how fast AI has become embedded in our daily lives.

   As with everything related to new technology, there are persistent
   concerns that AI is moving much faster than the guardrails being built
   for it.

   The federal government has a framework for proposed legislation, but
   The Artificial Intelligence and Data Act won’t come into force before
   2025. Federal Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry,

   released a voluntary code of conduct in late September for generative
   AI developers. In the absence of regulation, it is supposed to guide
   organizations to come up with an environment to self-regulate.
