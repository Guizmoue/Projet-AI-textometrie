   Programming note: Listen to a version of this story on CNN’s One Thing
   podcast with David Rind.
   New York CNN  —

   Tomato growers in central India have been increasingly worried about
   the volatility that extreme weather events have brought to the region.
   For much of the area, the last decade has been punctuated by severe
   droughts that led to significant crop loss, impacting the livelihoods
   of local farmers.

   On the other side of the world, Silicon Valley startup ClimateAi is
   developing an artificial intelligence platform to evaluate how
   vulnerable crops are to warming temperatures over the next two decades.
   The tool uses data on the climate, water and soil of a particular
   location to measure how viable the landscape will be for growing in the
   coming years.

   Maharashtra, India, was one of its first case studies in 2021. Farmers
   could go into the ClimateAi app and input what seed they were growing
   and where they wanted to plant it.

   With that data, ClimateAi ran simulations and found that extreme heat
   and drought would lead to an approximately 30% decrease in tomato
   output in the region over the next two decades. It warned growers that
   they should change their strategy.

   The results proved pivotal — tomato producers adjusted their business
   plans by switching to more climate-resilient seed varieties and
   shifting the times they plant tomato seeds. Finding new growing
   locations usually takes a while for farmers affected by climate change,
   but “now it can happen in a matter of minutes, and it also saves them a
   lot of cost,” according to Himanshu Gupta, who grew up in India and is
   the CEO and co-founder of ClimateAi.

   “The way we think about AI is it’s a time and effectiveness multiplier
   to the solutions for climate change,” Gupta told CNN.

   Better assessing future risks for farming is just one of the ways
   artificial intelligence technologies are being used to address the
   climate crisis.

   AI first crashed into the public consciousness this year thanks to
   popular, consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, and experts say the
   technology is set to revolutionize countless industries. But climate
   researchers have for years been thinking about how AI — computer
   programs that can rapidly analyze enormous amounts of data and complete
   complex tasks in ways similar to how a human might — could help them
   better understand and address the changing climate.

   Everything you need to know about AI but were too afraid to ask

   Now, experts say AI is poised to accelerate everything from reducing
   pollution to improving weather models.

   “Efficiencies is one thing that AI is very good at, optimizing
   decisions, optimizing resources,” said Fengqi You, chair professor at
   Cornell University’s engineering school. “It’s a system that has very
   strong predictive capabilities that could be tremendously helpful in
   many domains, ranging from (understanding) small-scale molecules … to
   broader climate systems to help us fight climate change.”

   With the breakneck pace at which the planet has been
   warming, accelerating the speed at which the world deploys and
   implements solutions is crucial. But for all of AI’s promise, the
   infrastructure that supports the technology — data centers filled with
   rows of powerful, energy-sucking computers — could itself be a strain
   on the environment. Experts say software engineers must work closely
   with climate scientists to find a balance.

   “It’s definitely something that has to be considered as this
   trade-off,” said Kara Lamb, an associate research scientist at Columbia
   University’s earth and environmental engineering department. Still,
   “the positives outweigh the negatives in terms of applying it to these
   types of approaches.”

Technology that speeds up discovery

   Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to various digital
   tools trained to perform a wide range of complex tasks that might
   previously have required input from an actual person. Generally, what
   these technologies have in common is their ability to rapidly process
   and find connections among vast amounts of disparate data.

   This makes AI particularly good at things like forecasting and running
   simulations. And unlike traditional computer programs, AI tools can
   typically continue learning over time as new data is available or as
   the systems receive new feedback about the quality of their outputs.

   While scientific discovery used to be reliant on humans’ ability to
   gather, observe and analyze evidence, computers can now process large
   datasets, identify patterns and run digital experiments in a fraction
   of the time that human researchers would need.

   while the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts renewable energy
   will account for 35 percent of worldwide power generation in 2025.

   ‘An agenda to control you’: How climate solutions got sucked into a
   fevered culture war

   “For the climate models, fundamentally we’re trying to solve these
   equations … how these atmosphere models are interacting, and it takes a
   long time to solve,” You said. Similarly, research on new energy
   conduction materials, like those for solar panels, could require
   countless hours of testing that can now be sped up using AI.

   “In the past, people used to need trial and error, we’d need …
   researchers working every day and night,” You said. “Now, because of
   AI, which doesn’t need to sleep, it just needs electric power, it could
   keep working 24/7 and it can become very helpful in accelerating
   discovery.”

   AI probably won’t replace the need for humans in the climate change
   fight. But it could make their work faster and more effective.

   Researchers seeking to restore coastlines by replanting seagrass, for
   example, are using AI to model the best locations to target those
   replanting efforts, said Dan Keeler, chief communication officer at
   impact investing firm Newday, which is involved in charitable efforts
   to support the coastal restoration.

   An AI algorithm trained to address the issue could take into
   consideration everything from toxins in the water or disruptive
   shipping routes to how replanting efforts could impact nearby sea life
   or even coastal tourism.

   “It’s very difficult to put all those together into a single model with
   conventional methods, but AI actually makes that much more possible,”
   Keeler said.

AI ‘doing the dirty work’ in climate research

   The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet,
   scientists have found. Rising temperatures are melting sea ice, thawing
   permafrost and igniting wildfires in what should be one of the coldest
   regions on Earth.

   Climate experts have said what happens in the Arctic is a bellwether
   for the rest of the world. But climate models – which scientists use to
   predict long-term change – are not capturing how fast it’s warming.

   They went hunting for fossil fuels. What they found could help save the
   world

   With the help of AI, Anna Liljedahl, a scientist at the Woodwell
   Climate Research Center, can make permafrost forecasts on a seasonal
   timescale, instead of on the typical 100-year timescale, giving her and
   other researchers a better picture of how fast the Arctic is melting.

   “AI is doing the dirty work,” Liljedahl told CNN. “But AI is not
   perfect, so we see it as a first tool, and then the human will come in
   after and really check and make sure that things make sense and explore
   the things that AI suggested.”

   The technology can also be used for solutions. A 2019 Google DeepMind
   project trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind
   turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to
   increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. AI
   can also help predict when and where energy demand is going to be
   highest, allowing grid operators to “make sure they have power online,
   ready to supply demand, and also that they don’t have power that’s just
   being produced and it’s going to be consumed, because that’s obviously
   a tremendous waste,” said Keeler.
   Artificial intelligence can be used to help better predict the supply
   and demand for renewable energy sources.

   ClimateAi’s Gupta said the problem is figuring out how to integrate
   renewable capacity into the existing fossil fuel-dominated grid. AI can
   identify in real-time which renewable energy sources are available in
   the areas where consumers want it — optimizing consumer demand and
   supply for renewables.

   Elsewhere, AI is also being used to research materials that could
   effectively recapture carbon from the atmosphere and to model and
   forecast major floods to help local government agencies better prepare
   for and react to potential emergencies.

   The Cool Down, a media company aiming to help consumers better
   understand the climate crisis and potential solutions, is set to launch
   an AI tool early next year that will answer user questions about how to
   live a more sustainable lifestyle, according to Anna Robertson,
   co-founder and head of content and partnerships. The tool will use data
   from its site about what kinds of climate information consumers are
   most curious about to direct users to information, including answering
   questions like, “What can I do with my old jeans?” or “I want to switch
   my laundry detergent, where should I start?”

   “Part of the problem is that the issue itself has become so
   overwhelming and mostly dominated by doom and gloom and not the
   solutions we have at our fingertips,” Robertson told CNN. “We want to
   make it easier for people to make better choices.”

Finding the right balance

   There’s a downside to all this computational power: Running artificial
   intelligence models is energy-intensive, and many data centers are
   operated in areas that are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels,
   Cornell’s You said. Data centers also typically require water for
   cooling — a dwindling resource in some places where this computing is
   being done, including the American West.

   For now, the amount of energy used to power AI is relatively small
   compared to what’s consumed by transportation or buildings. “But this
   is going to grow very fast, and we do need to be very careful at this
   moment before it grows exponentially,” You said.

   An October study from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the
   “worst-case scenario” suggests Google’s AI systems could eventually
   consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year,
   assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and
   software. Developers should be advised “not only to focus on optimizing
   AI, but also to critically consider the necessity of using AI in the
   first place, as it is unlikely that all applications will benefit from
   AI or that the benefits will always outweigh the costs,” the study
   concludes.
   Data center operators like Google are already thinking about how to
   reduce the resources needed to power the computing behind their AI
   models.

   Some data center operators are already beginning to address these
   concerns.

   Amazon Web Services, the online shopping giant’s cloud computing arm,
   has pledged to be “water positive” by 2030, meaning the company will
   “return more water to the communities in which we have our data center
   infrastructure than we take,” CEO Adam Selipsky told CNN in an October
   interview.

   In Oregon, for example, where drought has tightened its grip in recent
   years, AWS is providing the spent water used for cooling its data
   centers to local farmers for irrigation at no cost.

   The companies building and running data centers to carry out AI
   workloads can also think about strategically placing them in areas
   where they might require fewer natural resources to operate, You said.
   If data centers are built in colder parts of the world, for example,
   less water will be needed for cooling; Scandanavia has emerged as a
   popular location for data centers, also bolstered by its relatively
   robust availability of renewable energy sources.

   This controversial climate solution could be exactly what the planet
   needs. Or it could be a colossal disaster

   Lawmakers in the United States and abroad — who have in recent months
   increasingly turned their attention to developing guardrails for AI —
   should consider both the technology’s potential benefits in fighting
   climate change and its environmental impact when developing
   regulations, You added.

   “Regulators, decision makers, policymakers really need to think about
   this when they are looking at the growth of [the AI] industry,” You
   said. “The growth of the industry is not only about the software, tools
   and so on, but also how they operate these data centers.”

   Tech experts also caution that AI must be made affordable and
   accessible for low-income nations, particularly those in the Global
   South that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis yet contribute
   the least to global pollution, something Gupta hopes to address as he
   expands ClimateAi’s resources.

   “When it comes to AI being applied to climate change,” said Gupta, “I
   think we are just scratching the surface of the potential that exists
   both in terms of the impact it could create for businesses, but also
   the impact it could create at the humanity level.”

   This story has been updated to note that Himanshu Gupta is both the CEO
   and co-founder of ClimateAi.
