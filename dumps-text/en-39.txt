   Tech giant Nvidia posted record fiscal third-quarter 2023 revenue this
   week following robust chip demand. Here's why it is the company
   investors all want a slice of.

   Tech giant, Nvidia, released staggering revenue this week of $18.12
   billion (€16.62 billion) for the third quarter (Q3) of this year,
   higher than analyst estimates of $16.18 billion and amounting to a 206%
   year-on-year increase, as well as an increase of around 34% more than
   the previous quarter.

   The strong financial results were supported by exceedingly strong
   demand for the company’s graphic processing units (GPUs), which are
   essentially computer chips that render graphics and images by
   performing rapid mathematical calculations.

   The company also announced adjusted earnings per share of $4.02, higher
   than the $3.37 per share expected. Net income clocked in at $9.24
   billion, a massive leap from the $680 million seen in the last fiscal
   year’s third quarter.

   Data centre revenues soared to $14.51 billion, ahead of estimates of
   $12.97 billion, mainly boosted by cloud infrastructure providers. This
   was about 279% more than the same time last year and around 41% more
   than the last quarter.

   Gaming revenues clocked in at $2.86 billion, beating expectations of
   $2.68 billion. This was 81% higher year-on-year and 15% more than the
   last quarter.

Will 2024 be as profitable?

   The company expects the fiscal fourth quarter of the year to yield a
   revenue of around $20 billion, which would mean a growth of almost
   231%.

   Nvidia also revealed its new GH200 GPU during the third quarter, which
   is expected to be cheaper as well as have more memory storage than its
   current processors.

   Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, noted:
   “The company which produces GPUs, critical in the AI market, however
   warned that it anticipates softness in China in the fourth quarter
   because of US export controls.

   "It also warned about a potential impact to its business from the
   Israel-Hamas conflict. These two factors combined with lofty
   expectations for the stellar stock market winner this year, sent Nvidia
   shares lower by 1.7% after hours, extending a near 1% drop in Tuesday’s
   session.”

   However, she highlighted that the lower move is a mere drop in the
   ocean, compared to this year’s triple digit surge.

Impact of export restrictions

   Meanwhile, the firm noted how export restrictions will primarily impact
   Nvidia’s A800 and H800 chips from being exported to China, and could
   also extend to AMD and Intel chips.

   This is likely to be a matter for ongoing negotiations between the US
   and China. The US is attempting to block China’s access to
   sophisticated semiconductors, which could prove to be vital for
   military and artificial intelligence purposes.

   However, this has led to increased speculation that China could choose
   to retaliate with its own economic sanctions against the US. This could
   be particularly worrying, given how dependent the US currently is on
   Chinese imports.

   Back in October, when the US had announced extended export
   restrictions, Nvidia had reassured investors that they would not impact
   short-term earnings, but could affect longer-term prospects. This is
   the scenario being seen now.

   In order to somewhat circumvent these new sanctions, the company has
   been in the process of creating new government-compliant data centre
   products. However, it is unlikely that they will be ready in time to
   make a significant impact on the fiscal fourth quarter results.

The AI race and ChatGPT

   Nvidia has recently also seen far more demand due to the development of
   ChatGPT, which has sparked a race for other AI developers to create
   their own chatbots. As a result, more chips and GPUs have been in
   demand, which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, as long
   as consumers keep developing more Gen AI products.

   However, the company could still face issues with lower revenues and
   roundabout export channels, in case US export restrictions increase.
   Having to develop new compliant products to export could also take a
   hit on both its finances and competitiveness for the short-term at
   least, due to the time and capital involved.
