Artificial intelligence: the world is waking up to the risks

   The past week was intense in the world of artificial intelligence (AI).
   In the space of a few days, five documents were published by
   prestigious institutions all examining the issue of AI and its risks to
   humanity. Just a coincidence? Certainly not.
   [102]Cyber risks - [103]Louis Nauges - November 16, 2023

   All these documents refer to the risks linked to Artificial General
   Intelligence (AGI), which is level 2 of AI. Today's artificial
   intelligence, including generative AI systems like ChatGPT, fall within
   Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), which is level 1. This artificial
   intelligence can do a single activity as well as a human, perhaps even
   better.

   AGI and its level 3 successor, Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), are
   AIs that can accomplish all informational activities to a quality level
   that equals or exceeds what humans can produce. Currently, the expert
   consensus is that AGI could arrive between 2030 and 2040. Tomorrow,
   basically.

   These documents point to major risks for humanity, but are they right
   to warn us of these dangers? The answer is clearly yes.  I urge you to
   read all five documents, but if you were to read just one, it would be
   the one by [104]this group of 30 experts.

   This excerpt gives the general tone of the document: "AI advancement
   could culminate in a large-scale loss of life and the biosphere, and
   the marginalization or even extinction of humanity". It "coolly"
   suggests the extinction of mankind! The three ensuing documents each
   mostly resemble each other. They are very general declarations of
   intent full of goodwill but with little real impact.

   They were published by the [105]United Nations, the [106]G7 as well as
   the [107]Bletchley Summit, an international meeting organized by the
   United Kingdom that was held on November 1 and 2, 2023.

   No one will argue against the ideas expressed in the Bletchley
   Declaration signed by 28 countries with widely divergent interests,
   including the United States, China, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the
   European Union.  "The recognition of the need to take account of human
   rights protection, transparency and explicability, fairness,
   accountability, regulation, security, appropriate human oversight,
   ethics, bias mitigation, privacy and data protection."

   The fifth document is different - it is an executive order signed by
   Joe Biden on October 30, 2023. In 60 pages, the US president lists a
   hundred specific actions to be taken, and for each, the executive order
   names the public authorities in charge of carrying them out.
   Furthermore, the timetable is restrictive, with most of these actions
   being given between 45 and 365 days to be completed. It is far from a
   catalogue of good intentions: it demonstrates the United States' clear
   desire to do everything it can to maintain its global leadership of AI.

Where is Europe in this concert of recommendations?

   The European Commission has been working on AI since 2020. In June
   2023, it published [108]a document, EU Legislation in Progress,
   detailing work on a European Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) to
   follow the Digital Service Act and the Digital Market Act. The [109]AIA
   must now be submitted to the Member States, who can make changes before
   its final approval. No one knows how long this could take.

   To summarize, can we imagine what the future might hold for
   collaboration between humankind and AGI and ASI? If we are to believe
   Rich Sutton, professor at the University of Alberta in Canada and a
   recognized specialist in artificial intelligence, humanity must
   inevitably prepare to hand over the reins to AI, as this illustration
   from one of his [110]recent lectures shows.

   My recommendation: the challenges posed by the rapid arrival of AGIs
   and ASIs are among the questions that require quick reflection from
   directors of all organizations, public and private.

   Furthermore, the best AI specialists are often asked, "what is
   humanity's future in a world where AI performs better than humans?".
   The common answer? "I don't know." But that is no reason not to think
   about it, all together, and very quickly.
