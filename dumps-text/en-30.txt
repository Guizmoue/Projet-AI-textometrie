New research paves way for Artificial Intelligence in education

   Over 500 respondents contributed to the Department for Education’s call
   for evidence on generative AI.

   From:
          Department for Education and The Rt Hon Gillian Keegan MP

   Published
          28 November 2023

   Education professionals, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology
   specialists, and ed-tech experts are embracing the opportunities
   offered by AI in the education sector, according to the results of the
   government’s first ever Call for Evidence on Artificial Intelligence in
   Education, published today.

   Results show that many respondents recognise the benefits of AI and
   some are already using AI tools to streamline administrative tasks,
   create subject-specific resources and provide personalised support for
   learners with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).

   Other opportunities cited include the creation of more interactive
   lessons, and additional support for learners for whom English is an
   additional language.

   The respondents range from educators in schools, colleges and
   universities, to research bodies including The Alan Turing Institute
   and Jisc.

   The report will provide a base to inform future policy on AI, and the
   government is already supporting the sector to realise the potential of
   AI in education.

   In October, the government announced an additional investment of up to
   £2 million in Oak National Academy to create new teaching tools using
   AI, followed by a two-day hackathon hosted by the Department for
   Education in collaboration with Faculty AI, the National Institute of
   Teaching, which brought together teachers, leaders, students and
   technology experts to experiment with AI.

   Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said:

     Artificial intelligence is here to stay and it’s already changing
     the way we work and learn. To take advantage of this transformative
     technology, it’s crucial we get our approach to it right.

     It’s heartening that many education professionals are already seeing
     the tangible benefits of AI – something I witnessed myself at our AI
     hackathon earlier this month – while remaining alert to its risks.

     The results of the call for evidence give us a crucial evidence base
     to inform our future work on AI, helping us make the right decisions
     to get the best out of generative AI in a safe and secure way.

   Michael Webb, Director of Technology and Analytics at Jisc, said:

     It’s encouraging to see from this report how many institutions are
     already embracing AI, and how staff are using it in creative ways to
     improve education.

     The findings also help us understand the types of support and
     guidance staff need in order to make the best use of the technology
     going forward. This will enable us to ensure that the right skills
     training is in place, along with guidelines around safe, ethical use
     of AI.

   The Technology in Schools Survey, also published today, sets out how
   technology is used in schools and where they need support to use
   technology effectively. To improve access to technology, the Department
   for Education is investing up to £200 million to upgrade schools that
   fall below Wi-Fi connectivity standards in 55 Education Investment
   Areas, and working with commercial providers to enable all schools to
   have access to a high-speed connection by 2025.

   Morgan Briggs, Policy Research and Strategy Manager at The Alan Turing
   Institute, said:

     The use of generative AI in the education sector is a critically
     important area that deserves significant attention, and we welcome
     the Department for Education’s continued focus on it.

     There are multiple ways in which generative AI could benefit the
     sector – but simultaneously, there are concerns and risks that must
     be addressed. These include dependency on commercial generative AI,
     the possible infringement of rights, the spread of bias and
     misinformation, and plagiarism.

     To realise the full potential of these tools, it will be crucial to
     engage children and young people in the development and deployment
     of generative AI in education.

   Sir Antony Seldon, founder of AI in Education and Headmaster of Epsom
   College, said:

     It is great that the Department for Education is being proactive in
     its approach to artificial intelligence.

     It’s crucial that the government is alive to the risks and
     opportunities AI offers to the education sector, and this Call for
     Evidence, which we were pleased to contribute to, will form an
     essential part of that.

   While respondents are broadly optimistic about the benefits AI could
   bring, they also recognise risks around harmful content, intellectual
   property protection and concerns about accuracy.

   The Government’s AI Regulation White Paper set out the first steps
   towards establishing a regulatory framework for AI, including working
   with UK regulators on how they might need to regulate the technology
   given its cross-cutting nature and impact on various sectors, including
   education.

   The government committed to evaluate and adapt the UK’s regulatory
   approach as AI evolves, and the insights from this call for evidence
   will continue to shape policy in this emerging area.

   Earlier this year, the UK also convened the world’s first AI Safety
   Summit at Bletchley Park, which brought together world leaders,
   businesses, and civil society to build consensus on international
   action to ensure safety at the frontier of AI.

   This drive to harness the potential of AI comes as new analysis is
   published by the government on the impact of AI on Jobs and Training.

   The report illustrates how the education system and employers will need
   to adapt to ensure the workforce has the skills necessary to benefit
   from this emerging technology, which the Department for Education is
   supporting through a number of training opportunities, including skills
   bootcamps, apprenticeships and the Lifelong Learning Entitlement.

   The Department for Education has also today published research
   trialling the use of AI to explore how it could be used to support the
   civil service by providing summaries and analysis. AI was used to
   analyse the 38 Local Skills Improvements Plans as part of a pilot
   project with Faculty AI.

   In spring, the Department for Education will publish the results of the
   hackathon, further supporting the department’s work to understand how
   AI could safely transform the education sector.
