   Today, TrendForce shed some light on the future of high bandwidth
   memory (HBM) technology and HBM4, specifically, which is expected to
   debut in 2026. This upcoming technology promises to extend its
   interface to 2048 bits and substantially change the architecture.
   TrendForce claims that HBM4 will significantly depart from traditional
   standardized DRAM technologies to more customized solutions.

   HBM4 will be the first to use a 12nm logic process technology for its
   base die, which foundries, not DRAM makers, will now make. This
   development will be a collaborative effort between foundries and memory
   suppliers, which essentially means a symbiotic relationship to advance
   high-speed memory technology. The increased performance and enhanced
   feature set of HBM4 are tailored to meet the demands of future
   processors for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance
   computing (HPC) from key industry players such as AMD, Nvidia, and
   Intel.

   The shift towards customization in the HBM4 market is a crucial aspect
   identified by TrendForce. This deviates from the traditional,
   standardized approach of commodity DRAM, which signifies a major shift
   in the industry. Buyers are increasingly seeking custom specifications
   and are exploring innovative options, such as stacking HBM directly on
   top of the system-on-chips (SoCs).

   This trend towards customization is expected to bring new design and
   pricing strategies to the HBM industry. As memory technology becomes
   more specialized and tailored to specific needs, it paves the way for a
   new HBM technology era characterized by innovation, specialization, and
   a departure from the one-size-fits-all approach today. This evolution
   in HBM4 and beyond indicates a dynamic and rapidly advancing landscape
   in high-speed memory technology.

   Another standout feature of HBM4 is its transition from the current
   12-layer (12Hi) stacks to more advanced 16-layer (16Hi) stacks,
   increasing memory module capacity. This transition, expected to be
   completed by 2027, will necessitate using new hybrid bonding techniques
   to increase layer count while maintaining the integrity of the memory
   stacks.

   But while HBM4 will revolutionize the memory market, it is still years
   away. As a result, HBM3E is going to have quite a long lifespan.
