Is social intelligence the future of AI?

As Artificial Intelligence plays an important role in our everyday lives,
implementing social awareness is the next step toward the future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), according to researchers.

   Although Siri and Google Assistant have the ability to schedule
   meetings on request, they do not have the social awareness to
   independently prioritise the appointments. A team of researchers has
   argued that the future of AI calls for the implementation of social
   intelligence to ensure that the growth of the technology is not stunted
   by a lack of social skills.

   The work, ‘Artificial Social Intelligence: A Comparative and Holistic
   View,’ is published in CAAI Artificial Intelligence Research.

Artificial Social Intelligence is the future of AI

   “Artificial Intelligence has changed our society and our daily life,”
   said first author Lifeng Fan, National Key Laboratory of General
   Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Institute for General Artificial
   Intelligence (BIGAI). “What is the next important challenge for AI in
   the future? We argue that Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI) is the
   future of AI.”

   ASI includes multiple siloed subfields, including social perception,
   Theory of Mind, and social interaction. The researchers argue that it
   is important to use cognitive science and computational modelling to
   identify the gap between AI systems and human social intelligence, as
   well as current issues and future problems, for future advancements in
   AI.

AI models should incorporate social cues

   “ASI is distinct and challenging compared to our physical understanding
   of the work; it is highly context-dependent,” Fan said. “Here, context
   could be as large as culture and common sense or as little as two
   friends’ shared experience. This unique challenge prohibits standard
   algorithms from tackling ASI problems in real-world environments, which
   are frequently complex, ambiguous, dynamic, stochastic, partially
   observable, and multi-agent.”

   Fan argues that ASI requires a comprehensive approach, as unlike
   contemporary AI systems, improving specific components of an ASI system
   may not always result in improved performance. Instead, the future of
   AI needs technology that has the ability to interpret social cues, such
   as eye-rolling or yawning, to understand the mental state of other
   agents, like intent or belief, to co-operate in a shared task.

   “Multidisciplinary research informs and inspires the study of ASI:
   Studying human social intelligence provides insight into the
   foundation, curriculum, points of comparison, and benchmarks required
   to develop ASI with human-like characteristics,” Fan said.

   “We concentrate on the three most important and inextricably linked
   aspects of social intelligence: social perception, Theory of Mind, and
   social interaction, because they are grounded in well-established
   cognitive science theories and are readily available tools for
   developing computational models in these areas.”

ASI requires a holistic approach

   Fan argues that researchers should take a holistic approach to mimic
   how humans interface with one another and the world around them. For
   this to occur, an open-ended and interactive environment is required,
   as well as consideration for how to introduce better human-like biases
   into ASI models to accelerate the future of AI.

   “To accelerate the future progress of ASI, we recommend taking a more
   holistic approach just as humans do, to utilise different learning
   methods such as lifelong learning, multi-task learning, one-/few-shot
   learning, meta-learning, etc.,” Fan said.

   “We need to define new problems, create new environments and datasets,
   set up new evaluation protocols, and build new computational models.
   The ultimate goal is to equip AI with high-level ASI and lift human
   well-being with the help of Artificial Social Intelligence.”
