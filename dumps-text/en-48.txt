Sports Illustrated owner denies using AI and fake writers to produce articles

   Sports Illustrated accused of passing AI articles off as human-created
   content 06:53

   The corporate owner of Sports Illustrated is denying a report that the
   famed publication produced articles written by artificial intelligence
   under fake author bylines, while noting that it has withdrawn the
   stories pending an investigation.

   Futurism reported Monday that Sport Illustrated had used AI to generate
   articles, as well as headshots and biographical information for
   fictitious writers. The technology publication also said that
   information about the purported authors "disappeared from Sports
   Illustrated's site without explanation" after Futurism approached The
   Arena Group, a New York-based media company whose other publishing
   brands include Men's Journal, Parade and TheStreet.com.

   The Arena Group said in a statement posted on social media on Tuesday
   that the company's "initial investigation" found that Futurism's report
   "is not accurate." The articles highlighted by Futurism were produced
   by human writers for AdVon Commerce, which The Arena Group said
   formerly had a licensing deal with Sports Illustrated to write product
   reviews and other e-commerce content.

   "AdVon has assured us that all of the articles in question were written
   and edited by humans," a spokesperson for The Arena Group said in its
   statement. "However, we have learned that AdVon had writers use a pen
   or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy — actions
   we strongly condemn."

   Sports Illustrated is removing the articles produced by AdVon while The
   Arena Group continues its investigation, the media company said. Sports
   Illustrated has also ended its partnership with AdVon, according to The
   Arena Group, which didn't respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for
   comment. Stephen Cannella, co-editor-in-chief of Sports Illustrated,
   did not respond to an inquiry sent to his LinkedIn account.

   Futurism said Tuesday that it stands by its report.

   "Arena's response is just so bizarre, as everybody's been pointing out
   online," the publication said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. "The
   idea that people writing product reviews for volleyballs would need to
   protect their identities with pseudonyms is obviously absurd. And as
   for AdVon telling Sports Illustrated that all its articles are written
   by humans? Its employees disagree, and we've got a new story coming out
   about that soon."

Need for guardrails

   Although The Arena Group denies using AI to produce stories for Sports
   Illustrated, the controversy underscores the question of how the media
   industry and other content producers should address the "lack of robust
   ethical guardrails" on using the technology, Benjamin Lange, an AI
   ethicist and research group lead at the Ludwig Maximilians University
   of Munich  told CBS MoneyWatch.

   "Journalistic ethics requires adherence to basic principles of honesty,
   trust, accuracy and objectivity," he said.

   Several publishers and other companies have had to retract articles
   this year that were produced by AI. In January, for example, CNET
   published corrections for a number of AI-generated stories after
   critics noted they were rife with errors. In August, Microsoft in
   August pulled a computer-generated travel guide from its website after
   readers pointed out that it recommended tourists in Ottawa, Canada,
   visit a local food bank.

   Shares of The Arena Group, which is listed on Nasdaq, plunged more than
   22% on Tuesday to $2.09 following Futurism's report. The company,
   formerly known as TheMaven, rebranded itself in 2021 and is led by Ross
   Levinsohn, who previously served as CEO of Sports Illustrated. Earlier
   this month, The Arena Group announced that it had merged with Bridge
   Media Networks, which produces news, sports and other content.
