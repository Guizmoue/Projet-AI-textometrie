AWS and NVIDIA Expand Collaboration to Deliver Generative AI Infrastructure

   Amazon Web Services (AWS) and NVIDIA have expanded their collaboration
   to deliver advanced infrastructure, software and services for
   generative artificial intelligence (AI) innovations.

   The partnership aims to provide customers with the necessary
   technologies for training foundation models and building generative AI
   applications, the companies said in a Tuesday (Nov. 28) press release.

   As part of the collaboration, AWS will be the first cloud provider to
   bring NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips with new multinode NVLink
   technology to the cloud, according to the release. These chips will be
   available on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances,
   allowing joint customers to scale to thousands of GH200 Superchips. The
   GH200 NVL32 multinode platform connects 32 Grace Hopper Superchips with
   NVIDIA NVLink and NVSwitch technologies into one instance.

   Additionally, NVIDIA and AWS will collaborate to host NVIDIA DGX Cloud,
   an AI-training-as-a-service, on AWS, the release said. This will be the
   first DGX Cloud featuring GH200 NVL32, providing developers with the
   largest shared memory in a single instance. DGX Cloud on AWS will
   accelerate the training of cutting-edge generative AI and large
   language models.

   The collaboration also includes Project Ceiba, where NVIDIA and AWS are
   designing the world’s fastest GPU-powered AI supercomputer, per the
   release. This supercomputer will feature 16,384 NVIDIA GH200 Superchips
   and will be used by NVIDIA for its own research and development in
   generative AI.

   AWS will introduce three new Amazon EC2 instances powered by NVIDIA
   GPUs: P5e instances for large-scale generative AI and high-performance
   computing (HPC) workloads, and G6 and G6e instances for a wide range of
   applications including AI fine-tuning, inference, graphics and video
   workloads, according to the release. G6e instances are particularly
   suitable for developing 3D workflows and digital twin applications
   using NVIDIA Omniverse.

   The collaboration also extends to software development, the release
   said. NVIDIA NeMo Retriever microservice offers tools to create highly
   accurate chatbots and summarization tools, while NVIDIA BioNeMo
   simplifies and accelerates pharmaceutical companies’ training of models
   for drug discovery.

   It was reported in September that NVIDIA has become the go-to company
   for computer chips used in AI processes. The company’s market value hit
   the trillion-dollar mark earlier this year thanks to high demand for
   its chips that are used to train generative AI models.
