   Sports Illustrated deleted web articles after a report claimed they
   were generated by artificial intelligence and published under fake
   author names.

   Tech publisher Futurism reported the issue after finding author
   headshots on an AI-generated image website.

   The Sports Illustrated Union said staff were "horrified" and demanded
   "basic journalistic standards".

   The publisher's owner disputed the report's accuracy, but it said it
   had launched an internal investigation.

   Arena Group, which owns the Sports Illustrated magazine and website,
   licensed the content from a third-party company, Advon Commerce, a
   company spokesperson said in a statement.

   Sports Illustrated has since removed the content after the allegations
   were raised, the statement added. Arena Group is now pursuing an
   internal investigation and has ended its partnership with Advon
   Commerce.

   Advon Commerce, an e-commerce company that works with retailers and
   publishers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

   The Sports Illustrated Union said "these practices violate everything
   we believe in about journalism".

   "We demand the company commit to adhering to basic journalistic
   standards, including not publishing computer-written stories by fake
   people," the union said on X.

   Arena Group claimed that Advon Commerce had assured them "that all of
   the articles in question were written and edited by humans" and that
   the e-commerce firm regularly uses "counter-plagiarism and counter-AI
   software".

   The company alleged that AdVon Commerce had allowed its writers to use
   pseudonyms "in certain articles" to protect their privacy, however.
   That was why the AI-generated pictures were used and the author names
   cannot be found elsewhere on the internet.

   This incident at Sports Illustrated comes as concern grows in the media
   world that generative artificial intelligence could cheaply replace
   journalists and potentially spread misinformation. Various newsrooms
   have experimented with AI or released guidelines for employees and
   audiences to explain their approach towards it.

   Some newsrooms have made headlines, however, after publishing AI
   articles that included errors or falsehoods. Others gained attention
   for not marking stories as AI generated.

   Numerous Sports Illustrated staff said on social media that they were
   appalled by the findings in Futurist's report, particularly as Arena
   Group has made large cuts to staff in recent years.

   Mitch Goldich, an editor at Sports Illustrated who leads the union,
   said the magazine had done "real damage to the credibility of the
   hardworking humans I have been honored to work with for the past 9
   years".

   He changed his name on X to "Mitch Goldich (human)" to further
   emphasise the point.
