WHO outlines considerations for regulation of artificial intelligence for
health

   19 October 2023
   News release
   Geneva
   Reading time:

   The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new publication
   listing key regulatory considerations on artificial intelligence (AI)
   for health. The publication emphasizes the importance of establishing
   AI systems’ safety and effectiveness, rapidly making appropriate
   systems available to those who need them, and fostering dialogue among
   stakeholders, including developers, regulators, manufacturers, health
   workers, and patients.

   With the increasing availability of health care data and the rapid
   progress in analytic techniques – whether machine learning, logic-based
   or statistical – AI tools could transform the health sector. WHO
   recognizes the potential of AI in enhancing health outcomes by
   strengthening clinical trials; improving medical diagnosis, treatment,
   self-care and person-centred care; and supplementing health care
   professionals’ knowledge, skills and competencies. For example, AI
   could be beneficial in settings with a lack of medical specialists,
   e.g. in interpreting retinal scans and radiology images among many
   others.

   However, AI technologies – including large language models – are being
   rapidly deployed, sometimes without a full understanding of how they
   may perform, which could either benefit or harm end-users, including
   health-care professionals and patients. When using health data, AI
   systems could have access to sensitive personal information,
   necessitating robust legal and regulatory frameworks for safeguarding
   privacy, security, and integrity, which this publication aims to help
   set up and maintain.

   “Artificial intelligence holds great promise for health, but also comes
   with serious challenges, including unethical data collection,
   cybersecurity threats and amplifying biases or misinformation,” said Dr
   Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This new guidance
   will support countries to regulate AI effectively, to harness its
   potential, whether in treating cancer or detecting tuberculosis, while
   minimising the risks.”

   In response to growing country needs to responsibly manage the rapid
   rise of AI health technologies, the publication outlines six areas for
   regulation of AI for health.
     * To foster trust, the publication stresses the importance of
       transparency and documentation, such as through documenting the
       entire product lifecycle and tracking development processes.
     * For risk management, issues like ‘intended use’, ‘continuous
       learning’, human interventions, training models and cybersecurity
       threats must all be comprehensively addressed, with models made as
       simple as possible.
     * Externally validating data and being clear about the intended use
       of AI helps assure safety and facilitate regulation.
     * A commitment to data quality, such as through rigorously evaluating
       systems pre-release, is vital to ensuring systems do not amplify
       biases and errors.
     * The challenges posed by important, complex regulations – such as
       the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the
       Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the
       United States of America – are addressed with an emphasis on
       understanding the scope of jurisdiction and consent requirements,
       in service of privacy and data protection.
     * Fostering collaboration between regulatory bodies, patients,
       healthcare professionals, industry representatives, and government
       partners, can help ensure products and services stay compliant with
       regulation throughout their lifecycles.

   AI systems are complex and depend not only on the code they are built
   with but also on the data they are trained on, which come from clinical
   settings and user interactions – for example. Better regulation can
   help manage the risks of AI amplifying biases in training data.

   For example, it can be difficult for AI models to accurately represent
   the diversity of populations, leading to biases, inaccuracies or even
   failure. To help mitigate these risks, regulations can be used to
   ensure that the attributes – such as gender, race and ethnicity – of
   the people featured in the training data are reported and datasets are
   intentionally made representative.

   The new WHO publication aims to outline key principles that governments
   and regulatory authorities can follow to develop new guidance or adapt
   existing guidance on AI at national or regional levels.
