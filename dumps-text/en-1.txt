     * Summary

     * No sanctions should be imposed, joint paper says
     * Commitments would involve large and small providers
     * Paper suggests "mandatory self-regulation through codes of conduct"

   BERLIN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - France, Germany and Italy have reached an
   agreement on how artificial intelligence should be regulated, according
   to a joint paper seen by Reuters, which is expected to accelerate
   negotiations at the European level.

   The three governments support "mandatory self-regulation through codes
   of conduct" for so-called foundation models of AI, which are designed
   to produce a broad range of outputs. But they oppose "un-tested norms."

   "Together we underline that the AI Act regulates the application of AI
   and not the technology as such," the joint paper said. "The inherent
   risks lie in the application of AI systems rather than in the
   technology itself."

   The European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council are
   negotiating how the bloc should position itself on this topic.

   The paper explains that developers of foundation models would have to
   define model cards, which are used to provide information about a
   machine learning model.

   "The model cards shall include the relevant information to understand
   the functioning of the model, its capabilities and its limits and will
   be based on best practices within the developers community," the paper
   said.

   "An AI governance body could help to develop guidelines and could check
   the application of model cards," the joint paper said.

   Initially, no sanctions should be imposed, the paper said.

   If violations of the code of conduct are identified after a certain
   period of time, however, a system of sanctions could be set up.

   Germany's Economy Ministry, which is in charge of the topic together
   with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, said laws and state control
   should not regulate AI itself, but rather its application.

   Digital Affairs Minister Volker Wissing told Reuters he was very
   pleased an agreement had been reached with France and Germany to limit
   only the use of AI.

   "We need to regulate the applications and not the technology if we want
   to play in the top AI league worldwide," Wissing said.

   State Secretary for Economic Affairs Franziska Brantner told Reuters it
   was crucial to harness the opportunities and limit the risks.

   "We have developed a proposal that can ensure a balance between both
   objectives in a technological and legal terrain that has not yet been
   defined," Brantner said.

   As governments around the world seek to capture the economic benefits
   of AI, Britain in November hosted its first [16]AI safety summit.

   The German government is hosting a digital summit in Jena, in the state
   of Thuringia, on Monday and Tuesday that will bring together
   representatives from politics, business and science.

   Issues surrounding AI will also be on the agenda when the German and
   Italian governments hold talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
