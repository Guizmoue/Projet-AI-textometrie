   Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a role in hiring
   practices today. Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a role

   playing a role in hiring practices today.

   REGION – Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often enjoyed through the lens
   of a movie or television series. Photo manipulation is also a favorite
   pastime on social media platforms, but is the use of artificial
   intelligence becoming a real threat when it comes to jobs, especially
   for older people? Job seekers are already witnesses to technology
   taking over some positions such as cashiers by way of self-checkout
   kiosks.


Computer algorithms instead of human review

   Many employers are using AI and automation for hiring practices these
   days. While it may save on physical demand and wage payouts, such
   technology has also been a detriment to household income. The U.S.
   Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
   issued guidance to employers on the usage of algorithmic tools which
   could also have the potential to run afoul of the Americans with
   Disabilities Act.

   Now, there is a growing concern about AI and the inability to find
   employment due to feeling a hiring algorithm had discriminated against
   someone. This can be particularly hard on those who wish to work past
   traditional retirement age in order to save more money. Thankfully,
   there are law offices, such as the Renee Lazar Law Firm in Bedford, who
   assist clients who feel as though they have lost out on a job due to
   this type of discrimination. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke
   for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division stated, “Algorithmic
   tools should not stand as a barrier for people with disabilities
   seeking access to jobs.”


Legislature introduces bill to help

   Aside from a disability and according to a Gallup poll, a large number
   of people want to work past traditional retirement age. According to
   the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers 75 and older is
   expected to continue to grow. Earlier this year, as it became more
   noticeable how AI was quickly advancing, several bills were introduced
   before the Massachusetts Legislature’s Joint Committee on Advanced
   Information Technology, the Internet and Cybersecurity.

   Massachusetts State Representative Sean Garballey and Sen. Jason Lewis’
   bill (H 64/S 33) is supported by Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director
   at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Fitzgerald told the
   committee, “The problem we face with AI today is that it’s being used
   broadly in society to replace human decision-making with little to no
   rules about testing these systems for accuracy, effectiveness, or bias.
   And that has real tangible harms.”

   The Garballey and Lewis bill would create a commission to study the use
   of automated decision-making by government agencies and require the
   commission to create a catalog of the AI systems being used across
   state government and make that list public. The commission would also
   advise the legislature on regulations to put in place.

What older workers can offer

   Meanwhile, it is important to remember that AI cannot replace
   sought-after skills that older workers often possess. Skills like
   critical thinking, dedication, dependability, problem-solving, time
   management and discipline still hold great value. Nevertheless, being
   past the age of 50 does not mean the capability to keep up with
   technology is dead and done. CVS Health has developed a Talent Is
   Ageless program that is designed to recruit mature workers and includes
   options like flextime, compressed workweeks, job sharing and
   telecommuting.

   Through its “Discovering You!” training module, older employees have
   the opportunity to further their career through education and help
   inspire colleagues to follow suit, and a quarter of the company’s
   employees are over the age of 50. CVS also has ongoing partnerships
   with organizations that include the American Society on Aging, National
   Caucus and Center on Black Aging, Inc., and the Network of Jewish Human
   Service Agencies. There are approximately 356 CVS stores located
   throughout the state of Massachusetts.
