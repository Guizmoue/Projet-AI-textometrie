Physical Constraints Drive Evolution of Brain-Like AI

   Updated on November 26, 2023

Table Of Contents

   In a groundbreaking study, Cambridge scientists have taken a novel
   approach to artificial intelligence, demonstrating how physical
   constraints can profoundly influence the development of an AI system.

   This research, reminiscent of the developmental and operational
   constraints of the human brain, offers new insights into the evolution
   of complex neural systems. By integrating these constraints, the AI not
   only mirrors aspects of human intelligence but also unravels the
   intricate balance between resource expenditure and information
   processing efficiency.

The Concept of Physical Constraints in AI

   The human brain, an epitome of natural neural networks, evolves and
   operates within a myriad of physical and biological constraints. These
   limitations are not hindrances but are instrumental in shaping its
   structure and function. In the words of Jascha Achterberg, a Gates
   Scholar from the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences
   Unit (MRC CBSU) at the University of Cambridge, “Not only is the brain
   great at solving complex problems, it does so while using very little
   energy. In our new work, we show that considering the brain's
   problem-solving abilities alongside its goal of spending as few
   resources as possible can help us understand why brains look like they
   do.”

The Experiment and Its Significance

   The Cambridge team embarked on an ambitious project to create an
   artificial system that models a highly simplified version of the brain.
   This system was distinct in its application of ‘physical' constraints,
   much like those in the human brain.

   Each computational node within the system was assigned a specific
   location in a virtual space, emulating the spatial organization of
   neurons. The greater the distance between two nodes, the more
   challenging their communication, mirroring the neuronal organization in
   human brains.

   This virtual brain was then tasked with navigating a maze, a simplified
   version of the maze navigation tasks often given to animals in brain
   studies. The importance of this task lies in its requirement for the
   system to integrate multiple pieces of information—such as the start
   and end locations, and the intermediate steps—to find the shortest
   route. This task not only tests the system's problem-solving abilities
   but also allows for the observation of how different nodes and clusters
   become critical at various stages of the task.

Learning and Adaptation in the AI System

   The journey of the artificial system from novice to expert in maze
   navigation is a testament to the adaptability of AI. Initially, the
   system, akin to a human learning a new skill, struggled with the task,
   making numerous errors. However, through a process of trial and error
   and subsequent feedback, the system gradually refined its approach.

   Crucially, this learning occurred through alterations in the strength
   of connections between its computational nodes, mirroring the synaptic
   plasticity observed in human brains. What's particularly fascinating is
   how the physical constraints influenced this learning process. The
   difficulty in establishing connections between distant nodes meant the
   system had to find more efficient, localized solutions, thus imitating
   the energy and resource efficiency seen in biological brains.

Emerging Characteristics in the Artificial System

   As the system evolved, it began to exhibit characteristics startlingly
   similar to those of the human brain. One such development was the
   formation of hubs – highly connected nodes acting as information
   conduits across the network, akin to neural hubs in the human brain.

   More intriguing, however, was the shift in how individual nodes
   processed information. Instead of a rigid coding where each node was
   responsible for a specific aspect of the maze, the nodes adopted a
   flexible coding scheme. This meant that a single node could represent
   multiple aspects of the maze at different times, a feature reminiscent
   of the adaptive nature of neurons in complex organisms.

   Professor Duncan Astle from Cambridge’s Department of Psychiatry
   highlighted this aspect, stating, “This simple constraint – it's harder
   to wire nodes that are far apart – forces artificial systems to produce
   some quite complicated characteristics. Interestingly, they are
   characteristics shared by biological systems like the human brain.”

Broader Implications

   The implications of this research extend far beyond the realms of
   artificial intelligence and into the understanding of human cognition
   itself. By replicating the constraints of the human brain in an AI
   system, researchers can gain invaluable insights into how these
   constraints shape brain organization and contribute to individual
   cognitive differences.

   This approach provides a unique window into the complexities of the
   brain, particularly in understanding conditions that affect cognitive
   and mental health. Professor John Duncan from the MRC CBSU adds, “These
   artificial brains give us a way to understand the rich and bewildering
   data we see when the activity of real neurons is recorded in real
   brains.”

Future of AI Design

   This groundbreaking research has significant implications for the
   future design of AI systems. The study vividly illustrates how
   incorporating biological principles, particularly those related to
   physical constraints, can lead to more efficient and adaptive
   artificial neural networks.

   Dr. Danyal Akarca from the MRC CBSU underscores this, stating, “AI
   researchers are constantly trying to work out how to make complex,
   neural systems that can encode and perform in a flexible way that is
   efficient. To achieve this, we think that neurobiology will give us a
   lot of inspiration.”

   Jascha Achterberg further elaborates on the potential of these findings
   for building AI systems that closely mimic human problem-solving
   abilities. He suggests that AI systems tackling challenges similar to
   those faced by humans will likely evolve structures resembling the
   human brain, particularly when operating within physical constraints
   like energy limitations. “Brains of robots that are deployed in the
   real physical world,” Achterberg explains, “are probably going to look
   more like our brains because they might face the same challenges as
   us.”

   The research conducted by the Cambridge team marks a significant step
   in understanding the parallels between human neural systems and
   artificial intelligence. By imposing physical constraints on an AI
   system, they have not only replicated key characteristics of the human
   brain but also opened new avenues for designing more efficient and
   adaptable AI.
