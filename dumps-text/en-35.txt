   Commonwealth Bank has been named the #1 Asia Pacific bank and ranked
   sixth globally in the Evident AI Index for banks, a global standard
   benchmark of Artificial Intelligence (AI) maturity.

   CBA was also ranked joint #1 globally for its responsible AI
   leadership.

   The Index was released in November 2023 and covers 50 of the largest
   banks in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and assesses four key
   areas (talent, innovation, leadership and transparency).

   Gavin Munroe, CBA Group Chief Information Officer, said: “It’s the
   first time the index has featured banks from Asia Pacific. By taking a
   leadership role in AI we’re committed to bringing AI safely and
   ethically to make things better for customers and our people, as well
   as communities across Australia.”

   Alexandra Mousavizadeh, Co-Founder and CEO of Evident, said: “Given the
   pace of AI adoption, it’s vital that we’re able to track AI maturity
   across the banking sector, helping institutions harness the power of
   emerging technologies with openness and transparency, and sharing best
   practice so that all banks can remain competitive in the AI age.

   “We congratulate CommBank for performing so strongly across both the
   Leadership and Transparency pillars. The institution has been an
   industry leader in how it has coordinated and communicated its AI
   strategy.”

   AI has been a core strategic focus for CBA for a number of years.

   Mr Munroe said: “Growing our use of AI responsibly has been a core
   strategic focus and it is pleasing to see us ranking joint first
   globally for responsible AI leadership.

   “With recent advances in generative AI promising significant uplifts in
   improving customer experience and simplifying core operational
   processes, it is vital we continue to scale these approaches in a safe
   and responsible way."
