   WASHINGTON (AP) — Among images of the bombed out homes and ravaged
   streets of Gaza, some stood out for the utter horror: Bloodied,
   abandoned infants.

   Viewed millions of times online since the war began, these images are
   deepfakes created using artificial intelligence. If you look closely
   you can see clues: fingers that curl oddly, or eyes that shimmer with
   an unnatural light — all telltale signs of digital deception.

   The outrage the images were created to provoke, however, is all too
   real.

   Pictures from the Israel-Hamas war have vividly and painfully
   illustrated AI’s potential as a propaganda tool, used to create
   lifelike images of carnage. Since the war began last month, digitally
   altered ones spread on social media have been used to make false claims
   about responsibility for casualties or to deceive people about
   atrocities that never happened.

   Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, on Nov. 14, 2023. Kfir Bibas has spent
   nearly a fifth of his life in Hamas captivity. The 10-month-old was
   abducted from his home in a southern Israeli kibbutz on Oct. 7, when
   Palestinian militants snatched about 240 people and dragged them to
   Gaza. (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP, File)

   While most of the false claims circulating online about the war didn’t
   require AI to create and came from more conventional sources,
   technological advances are coming with increasing frequency and little
   oversight. That’s made the potential of AI to become another form of
   weapon starkly apparent, and offered a glimpse of what’s to come during
   future conflicts, elections and other big events.

   “It’s going to get worse — a lot worse — before it gets better,” said
   Jean-Claude Goldenstein, CEO of CREOpoint, a tech company based in San
   Francisco and Paris that uses AI to assess the validity of online
   claims. The company has created a database of the most viral deepfakes
   to emerge from Gaza. “Pictures, video and audio: with generative AI
   it’s going to be an escalation you haven’t seen.”

   In some cases, photos from other conflicts or disasters have been
   repurposed and passed off as new. In others, generative AI programs
   have been used to create images from scratch, such as one of a baby
   crying amidst bombing wreckage that went viral in the conflict’s
   earliest days.

   Other examples of AI-generated images include videos showing supposed
   Israeli missile strikes, or tanks rolling through ruined neighborhoods,
   or families combing through rubble for survivors.

   In many cases, the fakes seem designed to evoke a strong emotional
   reaction by including the bodies of babies, children or families. In
   the bloody first days of the war, supporters of both Israel and Hamas
   alleged the other side had victimized children and babies; deepfake
   images of wailing infants offered photographic ‘evidence’ that was
   quickly held up as proof.

   The propagandists who create such images are skilled at targeting
   people’s deepest impulses and anxieties, said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the
   Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that has tracked
   disinformation from the war. Whether it’s a deepfake baby, or an actual
   image of an infant from another conflict, the emotional impact on the
   viewer is the same.

   The more abhorrent the image, the more likely a user is to remember it
   and to share it, unwittingly spreading the disinformation further.

   “People are being told right now: Look at this picture of a baby,”
   Ahmed said. “The disinformation is designed to make you engage with
   it.”

   Similarly deceptive AI-generated content began to spread after Russia
   invaded Ukraine in 2022. One altered video appeared to show Ukrainian
   President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordering Ukrainians to surrender. Such
   claims have continued to circulate as recently as last week, showing
   just how persistent even easily debunked misinformation can be.

   Each new conflict, or election season, provides new opportunities for
   disinformation peddlers to demonstrate the latest AI advances. That has
   many AI experts and political scientists warning of the risks next
   year, when several countries hold major elections, including the U.S.,
   India, Pakistan, Ukraine, Taiwan, Indonesia and Mexico.

   The risk that AI and social media could be used to spread lies to U.S.
   voters has alarmed lawmakers from both parties in Washington. At a
   recent hearing on the dangers of deepfake technology, U.S. Rep. Gerry
   Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said the U.S. must invest in funding
   the development of AI tools designed to counter other AI.

   “We as a nation need to get this right,” Connolly said.

   Around the world a number of startup tech firms are working on new
   programs that can sniff out deepfakes, affix watermarks to images to
   prove their origin, or scan text to verify any specious claims that may
   have been inserted by AI.

   “The next wave of AI will be: How can we verify the content that is out
   there. How can you detect misinformation, how can you analyze text to
   determine if it is trustworthy?” said Maria Amelie, co-founder of
   Factiverse, a Norwegian company that has created an AI program that can
   scan content for inaccuracies or bias introduced by other AI programs.

   Such programs would be of immediate interest to educators, journalists,
   financial analysts and others interested in rooting out falsehoods,
   plagiarism or fraud. Similar programs are being designed to sniff out
   doctored photos or video.

   While this technology shows promise, those using AI to lie are often a
   step ahead, according to David Doermann, a computer scientist who led
   an effort at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to respond
   to the national security threats posed by AI-manipulated images.

   Doermann, who is now a professor at the University at Buffalo, said
   effectively responding to the political and social challenges posed by
   AI disinformation will require both better technology and better
   regulations, voluntary industry standards and extensive investments in
   digital literacy programs to help internet users figure out ways to
   tell truth from fantasy.

   “Every time we release a tool that detects this, our adversaries can
   use AI to cover up that trace evidence,” said Doermann. “Detection and
   trying to pull this stuff down is no longer the solution. We need to
   have a much bigger solution.”
