The US is racing ahead in its bid to control artificial intelligence – why is
the EU so far behind?

   Washington is laying down rules for the use of seemingly mundane AI
   that could, in fact, be incredibly dangerous

   Between fancy global summits, OpenAI’s boardroom drama and rumoured
   technical breakthroughs, the world has recently been paying close
   attention to the frontiers of AI research. But last month the White
   House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the US released a memo
   on the use of more mundane AI systems in government that is likely, in
   the near term at least, to be equally consequential.

   From its use tracking undocumented migrants, to the predictive
   algorithms police departments deploy to surveil populations and
   allocate resources, AI is now a common tool of the US government to cut
   costs – but at the expense of subjecting society’s most vulnerable to
   arbitrary rule without due process, and with predictably discriminatory
   outcomes. Researchers, journalists and activists have been calling
   attention to this for years. That call is at last being answered.

   The OMB is the largest unit in the US president’s executive office.
   Though little discussed, it is extremely powerful. It oversees other
   government agencies, ensuring their actions are aligned with the
   president’s programme. And last month, the OMB director, Shalanda
   Young, released a memo that could revolutionise the use of AI in
   government in the US.

   The proposed policy – it is still a draft, and could be watered down –
   would require each department to appoint a chief AI officer and have
   them provide a register of existing AI use cases. This alone is a
   significant win for transparency. But in addition, the officer must
   identify systems that will potentially impact people’s safety or
   rights, which are subject to further meaningful constraints.

   There are new requirements to weigh AI systems’ risks to rights and
   safety against their claimed benefits. Agencies will also have to
   verify the quality of the data they use, and to more closely monitor
   the systems once they have been deployed. Crucially, those affected by
   AI systems are to receive plain language explanations of how AI is
   being used, and the opportunity to contest AI decisions.

   These might all seem like obvious steps, but they are not currently
   being taken, and the result is more harm to the most vulnerable in
   society.

   The policy would also compel departments to actively ensure that AI
   systems will advance equity, dignity and fairness in how they are
   deployed, calling attention to the inherent unjust biases in models and
   the unrepresentative data on which models are often trained. Government
   departments must also consult affected groups before deploying such
   systems, and provide options for human consideration and remedy,
   allowing people to contest decisions that adversely affect them,
   instead of being subject to Kafkaesque “algorithmic blind spots”.

   Impressively, the memo even addresses the deeply unsexy but important
   question of government procurement of AI. So many societal problems
   with AI start with inexperienced government agencies adopting new
   software that they don’t adequately understand, which is oversold by
   its vendor, and which ultimately fails in ways that affect the worst
   off most severely. Describing and requiring best practices for
   procurement of AI systems is one of the most significant things
   government departments can do right now.

   The OMB memo is a case study in research and civil society-led
   policymaking. Current attempts to regulate frontier AI models (which
   can perform a wide range of tasks, including language and image
   processing), especially in the EU, could learn something here. In early
   2023, surprised by the popularity of ChatGPT, the EU parliament
   attempted to bolt on regulations for frontier AI systems to its
   (already flawed) AI Act. In the trilogue negotiations now taking place
   – where the parliament, the European Commission and the European
   Council try to reconcile their different proposals for the act – France
   and Germany recently pushed back, as they realised the possible
   implications of these proposals for their fast-rising domestic AI
   companies (Mistral and Aleph Alpha respectively).

   This disarray was predictable. GPT-4, the most capable frontier AI
   model, had barely been released when the first regulatory proposals
   were brought forward. Regulating a field that is seeing frequent
   research breakthroughs is hard. The ecosystem for deploying these
   systems is also fast-changing; will AI companies operate like
   platforms, tending to monopoly or duopoly power? Or will there be a
   robust competitive market for frontier AI models? We don’t yet know.
   There hasn’t been time for public interest research to offer balanced
   policy proposals, or for a well-grounded and robust civil society
   debate to take place.

   Some ideas for regulating frontier systems are no-brainers – the EU and
   others should clearly require far more transparency from the leading AI
   labs, especially with respect to any dangerous capabilities revealed by
   the next generation of AI systems. But beyond this, the wisest course
   may be not to rush things, and to foster the kind of civil society
   debate and in-depth research that grounds more mature policy, such as
   the OMB memo.
