US, UK and 16 other countries sign AI security agreement

   The UK has unveiled the world’s first global guidelines for making
   artificial intelligence (AI) tools ‘secure by design’.

   The US, Singapore, Australia, Chile, Germany, Israel and Japan were
   among the 18 nations that have signed a non-binding public agreement
   that aims to secure AI systems against cyber attacks.

   The document has been developed by the UK’s National Cyber Security
   Centre (NCSC) and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
   Agency (CISA), and endorsed by all G7 members. It was launched in an
   event in London, attended by more than 100 industry, government and
   international partners such as Microsoft, the Alan Turing Institute,
   and cyber agencies from the US, Canada, Germany and the UK.

   The guidelines set a ‘secure by design approach’, advising developers
   and organisations on the best practices for incorporating cyber
   security at every stage of the development process of AI algorithms.
   They focus on four key areas: secure design, secure development, secure
   deployment, and secure operation and maintenance.

   “Security is not a postscript to development but a core requirement
   throughout,” NCSC CEO Lindy Cameron said at the launch.

   The guidelines include advice such as the need to model threats to a
   company’s system, accounting for the growing dangers that come with
   growth, and the threat of future technological developments such as
   automated attacks. In addition, the document covers supply chain
   security, maintaining robust documentation, protecting assets and
   managing technical debt.

   When it comes to secure development, the plan advises that developers
   ensure the protection of the infrastructure used to support an AI
   system, including access controls for APIs, models and data. Moreover,
   models should be released “responsibly” – only when they have been
   subjected to thorough security assessments and making the most secure
   configuration the default for all users.

   The final section covers how to secure AI systems after they've been
   deployed, noting that companies continuously monitor systems, and the
   data that is entered into them, for signs of misuse.

   However, the guidelines do not address other concerns regarding the use
   of AI-generated content or the data chosen for its training.

   US secretary of homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas said: “We are at
   an inflection point in the development of AI, which may well be the
   most consequential technology of our time. Cyber security is key to
   building AI systems that are safe, secure, and trustworthy.

   “The guidelines jointly issued today by CISA, NCSC and our other
   international partners provide a common-sense path to designing,
   developing, deploying and operating AI with cyber security at its
   core.”

   The agreement is the latest in a series of initiatives – most of which
   provide general advice – pushed by governments around the world to
   ensure the ethical development of AI technologies. It follows US
   President Joe Biden’s signing of an executive order that would require
   AI developers to share the results of safety tests with the US
   government before they are released to the public. The order also
   directs agencies to set standards for that testing and address related
   chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and cyber-security risks.

   The Biden administration has been very vocal about its concerns over
   the rapid development of generative AI, and even unveiled a new AI Bill
   of Rights, which outlines five protections internet users should have
   in the AI age.

   The US and the UK were among the signatories of the Bletchley
   Declaration, described as a “landmark achievement” that signals a
   starting point in the conversations around the risks of AI
   technologies. The document has also been signed by representatives from
   the European Union and 28 countries, including China.

   UK science and technology secretary Michelle Donelan positioned the new
   guidelines as cementing the UK’s role as “an international standard
   bearer on the safe use of AI”.

   “Just weeks after we brought world leaders together at Bletchley Park
   to reach the first international agreement on safe and responsible AI,
   we are once again uniting nations and companies in this truly global
   effort,” she added.

   Last month, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak revealed the UK will launch an
   AI safety institute, following a similar announcement from the US.
