   WASHINGTON (TND) â€” Artificial intelligence (AI) use is not slowing
   down, but there are concerns that the technology is giving biased
   information.

   When asked if ChatGPT, a generative AI app, was biased, the app
   responded in seconds and said it was not.

     No, I don't have personal opinions or biases. I generate responses
     based on patterns learned from diverse data. If you have concerns
     about biased outputs, feel free to point them out, and I'll do my
     best to provide balanced information.

   Dr. Lisa Palmer, a college professor and artificial intelligence
   business strategist who designs business models, processes, and
   services, said that data apps like ChaptGPT use might not be so
   diverse.

   "The data set that they have been trained on is largely coming from
   publicly scraped data. As a result of that, that publicly scraped data,
   much of it is news and news content, etc. and we do tend to have more
   left-leaning news content that was scraped than right-leaning,
   conservative content," Palmer explained. "And so by the sheer virtue of
   that the responses that you get from these tools will tend to be
   left-leaning because the dataset, one of the key elements is
   left-leaning. "

   Research from the United Kingdom, China, the University of Washington,
   and Carnegie Mellon University confirms Palmer's assessment.

     The artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT shows a significant and
     systemic left-wing bias, according to a new study by the University
     of East Anglia (UEA).

   According to MIT Technology Review, you'll get more right or left-wing
   answers depending on which AI model you ask.

   "I do worry that people really think these are super cyborg machines
   that can do anything and are faultless and they're very, very far, far
   from it," said Christopher Alexander, Chief Analytics Officer of
   Pioneer Development Group. Alexander also worked on various projects
   for the U.S. government on the development and implementation of AI.

   A new study from researchers from the University of California, Los
   Angeles, the University of Southern California, and Adobe Research
   shows AI systems are guilty of gender bias when it comes to writing
   recommendation letters.

   When the recommendation was about a male, ChatGPT used words like
   "expert," "reputable," and "authentic." For females, it used words like
   "beauty," "icon," and "delight."

   "It's a perfect example of how these biases can be created, but they
   really come not from the AI, but from the way the AI was trained, or
   the type of outputs that the AI produces," Alexander said.

   According to Nielsen Norman Research, AI improves employee productivity
   by 66%.

   "You have to make sure that you are using your own minds and you are
   discerning what is biased and what is unbiased just as we do when we
   read any kind of content online," Palmer suggested. "There's nothing
   different with the use of artificial intelligence than any other online
   content that people are using on a daily basis. Just be aware and make
   sure that you're applying your own thought to the content that you see
   pulled back."

   ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, said the technology is not free of
   stereotypes and biases.

     ChatGPT is not free from biases and stereotypes, so users and
     educators should carefully review its content. It is important to
     critically assess any content that could teach or reinforce biases
     or stereotypes. Bias mitigation is an ongoing area of research for
     us, and we welcome feedback on how to improve.

     The model is skewed towards Western views and performs best in
     English. Some steps to prevent harmful content have only been tested
     in English.

     The model's dialogue nature can reinforce a user's biases over the
     course of interaction. For example, the model may agree with a
     user's strong opinion on a political issue, reinforcing their
     belief.

     These biases can harm students if not considered when using the
     model for student feedback. For instance, it may unfairly judge
     students learning English as a second language.

   Alexander said AI developers must be careful in their programming.

   "You produce capabilities that often sit on top of ChatGPT or sit on
   top of some of these other capabilities. And that's where the real
   problem is because you are writing these prompts to do something, say
   for marketing or advertising. And you don't know that the AI
   necessarily has this bias within it. And now that bias is working
   through like an entire ecosystem of products," Alexander explained.
