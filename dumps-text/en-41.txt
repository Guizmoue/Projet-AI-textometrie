Moncton researchers developing artificial intelligence to fight wildfires

   A team of engineers at the Université de Moncton is fine-tuning an
   algorithm that works with satellite and drone images to detect fires
   more accurately than humans. The technology also predicts where a blaze
   will spread, helping firefighters know where to send resources.

   Researchers in New Brunswick are developing a new approach to tackling
   Canada's growing threat of wildfires: teaching artificial intelligence
   to find them faster.

   A team of engineers at the Université de Moncton is fine-tuning an
   algorithm that works with satellite and drone images to detect fires
   more accurately than humans. The technology also predicts where a blaze
   will spread, helping firefighters know where to send resources.

   Moulay Akhloufi, a computer science professor and head of the
   Perception, Robotics and Intelligent Machines Laboratory, said it can
   help spot signs of a fire the human eye would miss.

   "It's very accurate. Some of the algorithms are able to get to more
   than 99 per cent performance when we want to detect fires," he said.

   After Canada's worst wildfire season on record, forestry and wildfire
   experts are turning to modelling and satellites as an increasingly
   important tool. While in early stages of development, some firefighters
   are already using artificial intelligence to inform decisions on the
   ground.

   "We are using machine learning, when and where appropriate, to do a
   better job managing wildfires," said wildfire expert Mike Flannigan,
   of Thompson Rivers University.

   "It's a very effective tool, though it's not a panacea. It's not going
   to solve all our problems."

Early detection

   Inside the Moncton lab, researchers are looking at how machine learning
   can help with both early detection of fires and modelling possible
   spread.

   The algorithm for spotting fires quickly analyzes data from different
   sources, including sensors on the ground and images from drones and
   satellites.

   With those pictures, it rapidly scans pixel by pixel to search for
   smoke or flames — a level of precision beyond what the human eye could
   detect. If it spots something of concern, the algorithm then considers
   environmental conditions — like heat and wind — to determine if it's
   actually a fire.

   of a wildfire based on environmental conditions.

   Akhloufi said they're working to build algorithms that adapt to
   different conditions, and with more satellites in the sky, the
   technology will be easier to use in Canada.

   "We use the data to train the algorithms, so they are able to detect
   these small pixels that show that there is some smoke or some fire
   starting," he said.

   The team of engineers is also looking at how drones could be used to
   battle fires from the sky.

   Marc-André Blais, a student researcher, said he's working to fine-tune
   an algorithm to pull off a "swarm attack" on a blaze.

   "So controlling thousands of drones at once is a complicated task for a
   human. For artificial intelligence, it's a lot more simple. So we train
   models and algorithms to solve that task," he said.

   Akhloufi said his team's fire-spread models will need more satellite
   data to be used in Canada. He said there's currently not enough
   information to make the models accurate enough to be used.

   "We just have to adapt to the geography where we want to work," he
   said.

First wildfire satellite

   The wildfire models and simulations often rely on data from hundreds of
   Earth-observation satellites.

   A new tool for getting a view on the skies is in development. In 2029,
   the Canadian Space Agency plans to launch WildFireSat, the world's
   first purpose-built satellite for monitoring wildfires.

   "Whether using drones or UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles], or small
   satellites or ground-based cameras, they basically allow you to have a
   more hands-off approach when it comes to fire monitoring," said Morgan
   Crowley, a forest fire research scientist with Natural Resources
   Canada who is part of the team working on the mission.

   "That's extremely ideal when you have so many fires all happening at
   the same time across the country."

   A team of New Brunswick researchers believes artificial intelligence
   could help firefighters better contain blazes.

   The new satellite is designed to pass over during peak burn period,
   which is the later afternoon. Canada currently has little aerial
   observation data at that time. The images and data will be in the hands
   of decision-makers within half an hour.

   Crowley said having more precise information will allow fire management
   teams to prepare for the next day and "triage" different fires.

   "You can't respond to every fire, nor should you, so being able to
   decide which ones are the most pressing, dangerous ones allows them to
   use their resources optimally," she said.

   Climate experts say catastrophic fires are a trend that will likely
   continue into the future, creating a growing need for new tools for
   firefighters.

   "We can expect more fire in the future as we continue to warm, longer
   fire seasons, more lightning, warmer temperatures," Flannigan said.

   "Research we did 20 years ago suggested that eastern Canada would see
   more fires mid-century. After 2023, I'm starting to rethink that. Maybe
   it's coming a lot quicker than we expect."
