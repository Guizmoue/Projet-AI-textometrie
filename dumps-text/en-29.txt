Marketers say Artificial Intelligence has a positive impact on performance

equity and inclusion efforts

   Marketers say Artificial Intelligence has a positive impact on
   performance In the past three years, 94.1% of marketers started
   integrating AI in their processes, 60.4% just in the last 12 months.

   Marketing leaders reported a rising optimism about the U.S. economic
   outlook for next year, despite inflation’s ongoing, dampening effect on
   marketing spending. More companies also report integrating artificial
   intelligence into marketing, saying it has had a positive impact. Fewer
   marketers expect diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to be a
   priority in the next five years.
   These are some of the latest results of The CMO Survey, a biannual
   effort of Deloitte LLP, Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, and
   the American Marketing Association. The survey is directed by Fuqua
   marketing professor, Christine Moorman. The research sampled 316
   marketing leaders at for-profit U.S. companies, 96% of whom hold
   positions at a vice president level or higher.

Marketing spending softens

   Overall, marketing budgets as a percentage of company budgets dropped
   to 10.6% this past year, near pre-Covid levels.

Too many choices: A model to predict open-ended consumer decisions

   Marketing spending rose 2.6% for the year, reflecting a 75% drop in
   growth compared with the figure a year ago (10.4%). However, consistent
   with the positive future outlook, spending is expected to grow to 7.2%
   next year.
   “Despite inflation hitting marketing spending this past year, CMOs seem
   to be more optimistic about the coming year, buoyed by stronger
   financial, customer and brand performance,” Moorman said.
   While the overall marketing investments are expected to be positive,
   spending for Customer Relationship Management, Customer Experience, and
   Brand Building, are all predicted to grow less in the next 12 months
   compared to last year.
   The 43% drop in Brand Building investments (from 9.6% to 5.5%) is
   particularly “dramatic,” says Christine Moorman.
   “One reason for this may be that marketers report a similar level
   increase in brand value, suggesting investments may be softened to
   ensure their ROI,” Moorman said.

AI use in marketing

   In the past three years, 94.1% of marketers started integrating AI in
   their processes, 60.4% just in the last 12 months.
   Roughly half of marketing leaders reported using AI for content
   personalization and content creation. In content creation, more than
   50% used AI for blogs, website content, social media, and email
   content.
   Overall, marketers reported a positive impact of AI technologies on
   sales (+6.2%), customer satisfaction (+7%) and marketing overhead costs
   (-7.2%).
   The survey points to several ways that marketing organizations could
   deepen their use of AI in marketing.
   “Marketers can increase use of AI to improve marketing ROI by
   optimizing the content and timing of digital marketing, for
   programmatic advertising and media buying, for predictive analytics for
   customer insights, and for targeting decisions,” Moorman noted. “These
   are all currently underutilized, with only one third of marketing
   organizations using AI for these purposes.”

Digital strategies

   A larger share of companies are in deeper stages of their digital
   transformation than a year ago.
   Although spending for influencers, mobile, and social media took a hit
   compared with last survey, CMOs predict investments in all three
   categories to grow significantly in the next 3-5 years (respectively:
   +109% to 12.2% of marketing budgets; +72% to 26.9%; and +65.8% to
   24.3%).
   Despite these announced investments, marketers reported these channels
   contributed only modestly to their companies’ performance, a skepticism
   that might be explained by their scarce reliance on experiments to
   quantify the impact of marketing actions on customers (only 36%
   reported running such experiments).
   “Marketing budgets will continue to be increasingly digital,” Moorman
   said. “Stronger use of AI and experiments that allow for insight into
   what is causing marketing investments to succeed or fail will be
   necessary for these budgets to pay off in companies.”

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion spending slows down

   With economic uncertainty, DEI initiatives took a hit this past year.
   This year’s growth in marketing spending on DEI initiatives dropped
   10.7% compared with a year ago, down to 2.3% annual growth. Fewer
   marketers reported that DEI is expected to be a priority over the next
   few years (less than 50% said DEI will be a priority). Overall,
   marketers said DEI has a weak impact on stock returns, sales, customer
   retention, customer acquisition, employee attraction and retention.
   “One reason for weaker DEI investments is that companies have not yet
   established a process to review and/or evaluate marketing decisions
   from a DEI perspective,” Moorman said. “We have been measuring the
   presence of this process since 2021 and it remains modest at 3.3 on a
   7-point scale where 1=not at all and 7=very highly. In fact, it is
   lower than it was in 2021 when it registered at 3.6. Without such a
   process in place, it is unlikely that DEI efforts in marketing will
   succeed.”
   Moorman noted that the top three social issues brands act for or
   against are LGBTQ+ equality, COVID-19, and racial equality— with
   roughly 50% of brands acting on each of those issues. Actions related
   to abortion (+580%), firearms (+227%), and climate-related issues
   (+70%) had the largest increases since 2021 as these hot-button
   societal issues have intensified in the last few years.

Marketing jobs

   Marketing departments’ size grew this past quarter more than the
   previous quarter (5.5% versus 3.4%), but this growth rate is slower
   than last year (12.2% and 15.1% increases in the 2022 surveys). CMOs
   reported that 20.2% of marketing activities are outsourced, a
   percentage that is expected to increase by 5% next year.
   “This growth is likely being fueled by the range of digital innovations
   that are infiltrating marketing, Moorman said. “Marketing organizations
   may need help to get up to speed efficiently.”
   At the same time, marketing hires for more standard roles are predicted
   to grow faster next year, fueled by stronger budgets, the survey shows.

Disintermediation trend

   Companies continued to add Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) channels,
   reinforcing a 10-year trend that sees firms rely less on ‘channel
   partners’ (like distributors, affiliates, etc.). There are industry
   outliers to this trend, though: Manufacturing, Consumer Packaged Goods
   companies, and large companies ($1B-10B+) continue to heavily use
   channel partners.

Marketing performance

   Companies’ performance proved strong relative to the pandemic, with
   profits and sales growing or remaining positive this quarter. Customer
   retention, customer acquisition, and brand value also strengthened this
   past year, with brand value increasing dramatically (+54%) from 6.3%
   growth last year to reach 9.7% in this survey.
   Moorman linked the aforementioned marketer optimism to these
   performance trends noting, “Marketing leaders seem to be focused on the
   quality of their returns and not worried about shrinking budgets. AI
   and digital strategies are also likely boosting their outlook on the
   future,” she said.
   Another reason for marketers’ brighter outlook may lie in the reported
   increase in collecting, sharing, and using more customer information to
   shape and evaluate marketing strategies—levels that have all increased
   over the last five years. “Nearly 30 years of scholarly and
   practitioner research shows that these types of information activities
   have a positive effect on company financial performance,” Moorman said.
