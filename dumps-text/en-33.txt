   For which tasks is artificial intelligence least well suited? Neil

   Skilled trades, nursing and nurses aides, surgeons, veterinarians, dog
   groomers, cleaning/janitorial, gardening and yard care, restaurant
   workers, personal care, physical therapy, street sweeping and snow
   removal, trucking and delivery drivers … off the top of my head in just
   a few minutes. Glad I’m a painting contractor/decorator! LizManus

   My husband’s job – maintenance in a residential care home. There are
   many and various repairs: broken power points, broken radiator covers,
   equipment checks, Pat testing, etc. A robot could probably paper a
   wall, but could it cut around light switches? Paint awkward spaces such
   as bannister rails? The jobs that are the least valued as far as wages
   go are the jobs that cannot easily be done remotely or by machines or
   robots – and those held by the same key workers who were so loudly
   praised during the pandemic and taken for granted before and since.

   Teaching – especially in teaching the act of communication in a
   community services context. We teach “active listening”, which includes
   paying attention to your body language, tone and biases, and responding
   to the listener’s. The complexities of human language can be taught in
   theory, but the human touch with regard to those suffering complex
   trauma would be hard to beat. Sadly, I can see people undermining the
   importance of this and replacing it with AI. Natasha2

   The laundry. I think it would have terrible trouble reading those
   little faded, creased “care” labels, although it could probably be
   trained to sort the colours. travellingran

   AI is particularly unsuited to psychic readings. Leoned

   ChatGPT says: “AI is least well suited for tasks that require emotional
   understanding, creativity and nuanced social interactions.
   Additionally, situations where a deep understanding of human values,
   ethics or complex decision-making based on subjective experiences is
   crucial may pose challenges for AI.” ProfessorSpi

   AI is least suitable for giving advice. Machines can “learn”, but in my
   experience they never understand or answer questions in a way that make
   sense. I don’t understand how businesses can rely on so-called
   chatbots. They cannot replace skilled staff members who have real ears,
   brains and voices. It also scares me that such “bots” are even used for
   providing counselling or therapy. AMD

   The current generation of artificial intelligence is very well suited
   to administrative or data-processing tasks. Many of the products are
   actually marketed as assistants or co-pilots, which indicates exactly
   how they are expected to be used. They are not so good at leadership
   roles or making decisions. Sure, they can help interpret data to
   support a human making a decision, but they can’t determine what the
   question is. For now, at least, they are our eager assistants.

   AIs are capable of some tasks typically assumed to be creative, such as
   creating artwork or composing music. But even here they only assist a
   human, giving someone without the ability to draw the ability to create
   a quality artwork. In short, they democratise tasks such as
   programming, writing, drawing or composing, allowing humans with ideas
   to direct the machines to create exactly what they want. They are not –
   currently – capable of the independent thought needed to come up with
   new ideas.

   The natural partner for the AI is the robot. AI technology leads
   robotic technology, meaning that AIs are much more pervasive in the
   digital world than in the real world. Manual tasks outside of a
   controlled environment like a factory or a warehouse are outside the
   capability of robots and therefore AIs. This will certainly change over
   time as robots continue to improve, but the improvements are likely to
   be slower than with the AIs themselves. PMC
